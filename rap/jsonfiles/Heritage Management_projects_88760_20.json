"grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Theatre Film and Television Studies", "abstractText": "The winter storms of 2013-2014 set new precedents of coastal damage in the UK, forcing government, heritage bodies and local communities to seriously reconsider the future management of coastal heritage. Relevant organisations were seemingly unprepared for these events, and communities were possibly surprised by what had happened, as well as by their own emotional response. Over 8200 miles away, in the low-lying island nation of Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean, over 100,000 citizens face the possibility of permanent relocation due to climate change and sea-level rise which threaten homeland and heritage. Troubling in itself, Kiribati also presents an unsettling visualisation of a collective future. These diverse settings are brought together in this project through the exploration of current and potential loss of heritage in times of accelerated climate change.\n\nIn the UK our project partners, the National Trust, own 742 miles of coastline and face difficult negotiations regarding their Coastal Adaptation Strategy. This research will consider the challenges facing heritage organisations and communities by focusing on three case studies; two of these are National Trust sites: Porthdinllaen (in North Wales) and Durgan Village (in Cornwall), with these two villages at risk respectively of increased tidal flooding and coastal erosion. The third case study in Kiribati considers a more urgent situation, exploring the societal and personal effect of potential whole-scale loss on perceptions of heritage, sense of place, religious beliefs and cultural identity. At each distinct site we will explore community, heritage and government responses to current challenges, as well as strategies for a stormy future. The data collected will be archived with project partners National Library of Wales and Cornish Audio Visual Archive, providing a legacy for this research and the communities under threat. More immediately, we hope to inform improved communication and consultation processes for these and comparative communities in future.\n\nWhereas popular imaginings of 'heritage' are likely to include buildings or assets with acknowledged historic value, there is an increased awareness among heritage organisations and administrations such as the Welsh Government that the more 'ordinary' or 'everyday' can also be valuable to communities, embedded in local history and the texture of lived lives. Broader definitions of heritage could include a bus shelter, coastal path, or even a particular tree, because they have meaning to the people who experience them. In order to deepen our understanding of 'sense of place', we will use a multi-layered interpretation of heritage as a concept and a process relating both to the tangible as well as the intangible (values, beliefs, practices). This strategy is essential to fully appreciate the subtle and traumatic ways in which climate-change disrupts community lives and identities, with potentially painful transitions ahead.\n\nThis interdisciplinary project invites collaboration with the Australian poet Mark Tredinnick, who will visit Kiribati and offer a poetic response to the effects of climate change on 'place' in more abstract terms. This research claims a greater stake for arts and humanities disciplines in climate adaptation debates, mostly dominated by natural and social scientists, and we will adopt an innovative approach towards engagement in and dissemination of our research. There will be poetry, films, conversation and community stories as well as scholarly and qualitative analysis. Artistic responses will be useful in connecting and articulating perceptions of the past and imaginings of the future at these sites, and in a broader cultural context. Our edited films, freely available to relevant organisations, may serve to amplify and bridge multiple voices, forging local and international cross-cultural understanding of the effect of climate change on heritage, communities and sense of place.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "Our research will develop deeper understandings and framings of heritage loss at a local level and international level, investigate how the impacts of climate change disrupt this heritage, and seek strategies for improved communication and consultation around these issues. This work will benefit communities at a grassroots level through direct engagement, as well as comparative communities in future. We will create multi-media resources and make them freely available to pro-actively targeted organisations, share our findings through our website, and promote the research through social media. This is a conscious effort to inhabit local, national and transnational public spheres, with collective benefits from enhanced dialogue and 'good information'.\n\n1. Policy-makers and government: We will engage relevant government/policy makers (national, regional and community levels) through interviews, and shared findings. In Wales, the Welsh Government is currently holding a 'national conversation' about climate-change, are interested in 'sense of place' work and site public communication as a key priority with flooding and coastal adaptation. The WG is loosely connected to the project through these collaborators: (i) Sustainable Wales (who have agreed to host videos), (ii) Climate Outreach Information Network (lead advisors for the Welsh Government on sustainable development narratives), and (iii) Prof. Mike Philips, professor of coastal geomorphology (project advisor, active in policy circles). In Kiribati we have access to policy makers through the involvement of Claire Anterea Kaitaake (Kiribati Adaptation Project), and through the advice of Riibeta Abeta, former Senior Environment Officer (Kiribati Government). Our multi-media resources would be made freely available to the Kiribati Government for local and international advocacy and informational purposes. \n\n2. International organisations: We are in dialogue with: Climate Outreach Information Network (our collaborators) and Pacific Calling Partnership, and seek to develop connections with: Pacific Island Development Programme, Pacific Water Institute, United Nations Environment Programme, Union of Concerned Scientists\n\n3. Third Sector: The National Trust (partners) are integrated into our research in several ways: attending out symposia (beginning and end of project); grass-roots involvement in the UK case studies; interviewed as part of our contextual overview on heritage organisations and climate change. They will share and disseminate findings through their organisation and networks. With our partners, the National Library of Wales and the Cornish Audio Visual Archive, we will co-develop methodologies for archiving the contemporary life that we encounter in our case studies. This will have long-term impact for NLW and CAVA, future researchers, and the documented communities. With a strong religious aspect to our research in Kiribati, we would target: Christian Aid, World Council of Churches, Forum on Religion and Ecology (FORE).\n\n4. Creative Collaborations: We have two direct non-HEI collaborations to create artistic work which can reach a broad international audience (i) Australian poet Mark Tredinnick will visit Kiribati, to write about 'place' in times of accelerated climate change; (ii) The PI will collaborate with Kiribati locals and sound-recordist Richard Gott to create short online films. Arts output will be publicised and disseminated by project collaborators: Cape Farewell and Welsh Literature Exchange, and will interest: New Welsh Review, Planet Magazine, Association for the Study of Literature and the Environment (ASLE), Centre for Contemporary Art and the Natural World (CCANW), RANE (Research in Art and Nature), and various literary publications.\n\n5. The media: We would contact Guardian online, Australia Network News online, OneClimate, The Kiribati Independent etc and local media at case-study sites (radio, newspapers, community newsletters.)", "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247", "text": "Cultural & museum studies", "percentage": 0}]}, "researchTopics": {"researchTopic": [{"id": "AD75E543-5F70-43C2-A40D-4452373465C4", "text": "Heritage Management", "percentage": 0}]}, "rcukProgrammes": {"rcukProgramme": []}, "start": null, "end": null, "participantValues": null}, {"links": {"link": [{"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/60E7E0E1-9184-4E6E-A3EE-A43632A474FB", "rel": "PI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/3A5E126D-C175-4730-9B7B-E6D8CF447F83", "rel": "LEAD_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/funds/083D103A-7516-4E9E-8B2D-A51A138CFCF4", "rel": "FUND", "start": 1204329600000, "end": 1212188400000, "otherAttributes": {}}]}, "ext": null, "id": "05831667-D7CD-4189-B377-F3C798A05357", "outcomeid": null, "href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/projects/05831667-D7CD-4189-B377-F3C798A05357", "created": 1582643293000, "updated": null, "identifiers": {"identifier": [{"value": "AH/F013019/1", "type": "RCUK"}]}, "title": "Collections for people: the stored collections of museums as a public resource", "status": "Closed", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Institute of Archaeology", "abstractText": "Why are we keeping all that stuff?' is increasingly asked about museums' stored collections. This project aims to provide answers, and to determine the factors associated with fuller use. To what extent are collections accessed and used, by whom and for what purposes? What seem to be the obstacles to using collections? What could museums do to generate better access and use?\\n\\nIt is being undertaken in collaboration with the major national players in the sector. The MLA and the Museum Documentation Association have funded a research fellow. A Steering Group includes the National Museum Directors' Conference, the Museums Association and ICON: the Institute for Conservation.\\n\\nResearch context\\n\\nThere are over 2000 museums in England and Wales. Their collections comprise an estimated 200 million objects, yet less than 10 per cent. are on display. There is only rudimentary and patchy quantitative or qualitative evidence on the extent that collections are accessed or used, in surveys and reports from the Museums, Libraries and Archive Council (MLA), regional museum bodies and others.\\n\\nAims and objectives\\n\\nThe objectives of the project are to establish:\\n\\n- The scope and use of the collections: their size, distribution geographically and among different types of museum, and their wide variety. Collections range from a few objects to millions; from specialist to general; representing different subjects and types of object. The research is establishing the extent to which collections are being used, what collections, by what groups of users, how much, and for what purposes.\\n\\n- The extent to which different types of collection are used by people other than museum staff; what are the types of user; and what uses they make of collections, such as research, teaching and learning, creative activities, individual interest, visits for enjoyment such as store tours. (Keene, 2005).\\n\\n- How museums provide for collections use, by actively marketing, or publishing information on what is in their collections. What they see as the impediments to increasing use.\\n\\n- How museums provide for collections use, and how users experience the service. What factors users find helpful, and what are the barriers and problems they encounter. \\n\\n- What factors are associated with fuller or less use: the kind of museum; collection size; and type of collection. The effect of practical issues: convenience of access; relationship with local or subject based interest groups; and how people find out what the collection comprises.\\n \\nOther objectives are to disseminate the results through an informative website, a generally accessible report, a detailed scholarly publication, and a national conference to be held in summer 2008; and to leave a research archive for future researchers.\\n\\nResearch methods\\n\\nThe research archive of extensive existing work from the various MLAs and other organisations is being assembled via online and print publications. A quantitative and qualitative survey has gathered data on collections, their uses and users, supplemented by telephone discussions, case study visits and workshops for museums. Users of collections are being identified and contacted in parallel.\\n\\nPotential applications and benefits\\n\\nThe many museum professionals contacted in the research are extremely interested in the research. The steering group for the project includes the major national organisations.\\n\\nWorking with these organisations, findings will be disseminated through workshops for museums, held in London, Newcastle and Birmingham; publication in an informative website, a detailed academic publication and a public summary report; and a national conference, to be held at the end of the project. Finally, an organised research archive will provide the basis for future work.\\n\\nThe outcome will be a much better understanding by museums and also policy and strategic bodies of how collections as a public resource can be better used.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": null, "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247", "text": "Cultural & museum studies", "percentage": 0}]}, "researchTopics": {"researchTopic": [{"id": "AD75E543-5F70-43C2-A40D-4452373465C4", "text": "Heritage Management", "percentage": 0}]}, "rcukProgrammes": {"rcukProgramme": []}, "start": null, "end": null, "participantValues": null}, {"links": {"link": [{"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/FF1391E6-8FC9-47A6-95B3-5AFC7A0D8332", "rel": "PI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/EED8B75A-C2E5-4E54-B23D-25EA0371213B", "rel": "COI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/8319F78A-DCBD-49F6-BE00-78E1CD75CDA9", "rel": "LEAD_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/6DF88DB6-74E4-4AD4-8BFE-E41ADC3B9F88", "rel": "PP_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/funds/EB556424-A6FB-4992-B55A-2AEFC10A32D8", "rel": "FUND", "start": 1548028800000, "end": 1561676400000, "otherAttributes": {}}]}, "ext": null, "id": "E7E96B45-F043-4F80-8A22-F37F998F1BC9", "outcomeid": null, "href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/projects/E7E96B45-F043-4F80-8A22-F37F998F1BC9", "created": 1582643293000, "updated": null, "identifiers": {"identifier": [{"value": "AH/S010580/1", "type": "RCUK"}]}, "title": "Heritage-led urban regeneration: a scalable model for community engagement using immersive technologies", "status": "Closed", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Archaeology", "abstractText": "This project explores the capacity of immersive technologies to inform urban regeneration strategies, by harnessing the power of cultural heritage through community advocacy. We will undertake a consultation exercise with a selection of community heritage groups with an interest in urban heritage, to identify the ways in which they could employ immersive technologies to articulate their ideas and contributions to regeneration initiatives. They frequently have a wealth of knowledge about hidden or lost heritage assets which could inform regeneration projects, but do not always have the means to disseminate this beyond websites. A handful of recent projects have employed immersive experiences, both VR and AR, to present this heritage although this has tended to be driven by SMEs or university researchers, often providing funding unavailable to community heritage groups. While this has begun to show the potential of such technologies, the means for community heritage groups to engage with such technologies themselves, or to be able to approach SMEs to develop compelling funding applications has not hitherto been scoped or shared. We will therefore consult with creative industry SMEs who possess the relevant skills set to support the development of immersive experiences by such groups. We are seeking to identify the most effective, practicable and affordable means for community heritage groups to work with creative industry SMEs to use immersive technologies to champion imaginative regeneration. \n\nOur project is framed with respect to the expectation that clearly now exists that local councils should lie at the heart of local action, and the recognition that urban regeneration initiatives frequently see councils engaged in co-production with community groups. We will scope out opportunities and methods of working through a review of existing projects employing immersive experiences in community engagement from across the country, both those driven by community groups and those delivered by sector leaders. We will hold a focus group workshop drawing on locally-based community heritage groups with an urban regeneration focus, creative industry SMEs and academic colleagues, to inform our reporting, and provide feedback on our initial findings and to assist in finalising our recommendations. We will use our consultation to propose a roadmap, or workflow, for producing community-led immersive experiences, identifying the kinds of challenges that are part of that workflow and which companies could help to solve them, thus promoting the different creative industries that could be involved. We will disseminate the results of our work in the form of both a written report and a video showcase. It is vitally important to give community heritage groups the tools to increase their effectiveness in their contributions to the future of their towns and cities; providing a roadmap to show them what they can achieve themselves using their typically extensive knowledge of the heritage of their areas and guiding them to the resources and partnerships they need to make compelling funding applications to acquire technical support where needed.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "The immediate beneficiaries of our project will be community heritage groups who are seeking to promote the heritage of the towns and cities in which they live and to advocate for this heritage to be recognised in regeneration initiatives. It is clear that local councils are increasingly likely to involve community groups in their regeneration projects, as the former have both extensive knowledge about local heritage and also a commitment to disseminating this. In this project we are developing a roadmap, or model workflow, to guide community groups in how to make use of immersive technologies to articulate their work, whether this be easily available software packages or the need to team up with creative industry sector SMEs to seek funding. The project responds to a need in the urban regeneration process to give local communities an effective voice. In a 2017 joint report by the Local Government Association, Chief Cultural &amp; Leisure Officers Association and Arts Council England (https://www.local.gov.uk/people-culture-place-role-culture-placemaking) it was argued that community engagement should lie at the heart of successful 'placemaking', and that this requires strong partnership working. In our project we are demonstrating that immersive technologies can enable and empower local communities to engage with local government and urban regeneration initiatives, and that local councils are interested in using its capabilities. There are certainly questions about extensibility, scalability, and how to involve the creative industries more widely to develop a workflow for a range of situations, and we will scope out responses to these issues. Our project will involve consultation with community heritage groups, creative sector SMEs and those involved in urban regeneration and its outcomes will be both a written report and a video showcase to present the roadmap and also exemplars of good practice. Community heritage groups have considerable knowledge about the history and heritage of their towns and cities, and are already often engaged in disseminating this through websites they create, but there are a host of new technologies available to them that our work will identify and explain. The work we are doing will also be of value to creative industry SMEs as it articulates for them a community need and identifies how they could collaborate with community groups to develop successful funding bids to deliver immersive experiences that contribute to the urban regeneration process.", "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []},

"grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Sch of Humanities and Cultural Industrie", "abstractText": "The winter storms of 2013-2014 set new precedents of coastal damage in the UK, forcing government, heritage bodies and local communities to seriously reconsider the future management of coastal heritage. Relevant organisations were seemingly unprepared for these events, and communities were possibly surprised by what had happened, as well as by their own emotional response. Over 8200 miles away, in the low-lying island nation of Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean, over 100,000 citizens face the possibility of permanent relocation due to climate change and sea-level rise which threaten homeland and heritage. Troubling in itself, Kiribati also presents an unsettling visualisation of a collective future. These diverse settings are brought together in this project through the exploration of current and potential loss of heritage in times of accelerated climate change.\n\nIn the UK our project partners, the National Trust, own 742 miles of coastline and face difficult negotiations regarding their Coastal Adaptation Strategy. This research will consider the challenges facing heritage organisations and communities by focusing on three case studies; two of these are National Trust sites: Porthdinllaen (in North Wales) and Durgan Village (in Cornwall), with these two villages at risk respectively of increased tidal flooding and coastal erosion. The third case study in Kiribati considers a more urgent situation, exploring the societal and personal effect of potential whole-scale loss on perceptions of heritage, sense of place, religious beliefs and cultural identity. At each distinct site we will explore community, heritage and government responses to current challenges, as well as strategies for a stormy future. The data collected will be archived with project partners National Library of Wales and Cornish Audio Visual Archive, providing a legacy for this research and the communities under threat. More immediately, we hope to inform improved communication and consultation processes for these and comparative communities in future.\n\nWhereas popular imaginings of 'heritage' are likely to include buildings or assets with acknowledged historic value, there is an increased awareness among heritage organisations and administrations such as the Welsh Government that the more 'ordinary' or 'everyday' can also be valuable to communities, embedded in local history and the texture of lived lives. Broader definitions of heritage could include a bus shelter, coastal path, or even a particular tree, because they have meaning to the people who experience them. In order to deepen our understanding of 'sense of place', we will use a multi-layered interpretation of heritage as a concept and a process relating both to the tangible as well as the intangible (values, beliefs, practices). This strategy is essential to fully appreciate the subtle and traumatic ways in which climate-change disrupts community lives and identities, with potentially painful transitions ahead.\n\nThis interdisciplinary project invites collaboration with the Australian poet Mark Tredinnick, who will visit Kiribati and offer a poetic response to the effects of climate change on 'place' in more abstract terms. This research claims a greater stake for arts and humanities disciplines in climate adaptation debates, mostly dominated by natural and social scientists, and we will adopt an innovative approach towards engagement in and dissemination of our research. There will be poetry, films, conversation and community stories as well as scholarly and qualitative analysis. Artistic responses will be useful in connecting and articulating perceptions of the past and imaginings of the future at these sites, and in a broader cultural context. Our edited films, freely available to relevant organisations, may serve to amplify and bridge multiple voices, forging local and international cross-cultural understanding of the effect of climate change on heritage, communities and sense of place.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "Our research will develop deeper understandings and framings of heritage loss at a local level and international level, investigate how the impacts of climate change disrupt this heritage, and seek strategies for improved communication and consultation around these issues. This work will benefit communities at a grassroots level through direct engagement, as well as comparative communities in future. We will create multi-media resources and make them freely available to pro-actively targeted organisations, share our findings through our website, and promote the research through social media. This is a conscious effort to inhabit local, national and transnational public spheres, with collective benefits from enhanced dialogue and 'good information'.\n\n1. Policy-makers and government: We will engage relevant government/policy makers (national, regional and community levels) through interviews, and shared findings. In Wales, the Welsh Government is currently holding a 'national conversation' about climate-change, are interested in 'sense of place' work and site public communication as a key priority with flooding and coastal adaptation. The WG is loosely connected to the project through these collaborators: (i) Sustainable Wales (who have agreed to host videos), (ii) Climate Outreach Information Network (lead advisors for the Welsh Government on sustainable development narratives), and (iii) Prof. Mike Philips, professor of coastal geomorphology (project advisor, active in policy circles). In Kiribati we have access to policy makers through the involvement of Claire Anterea Kaitaake (Kiribati Adaptation Project), and through the advice of Riibeta Abeta, former Senior Environment Officer (Kiribati Government). Our multi-media resources would be made freely available to the Kiribati Government for local and international advocacy and informational purposes. \n\n2. International organisations: We are in dialogue with: Climate Outreach Information Network (our collaborators) and Pacific Calling Partnership, and seek to develop connections with: Pacific Island Development Programme, Pacific Water Institute, United Nations Environment Programme, Union of Concerned Scientists\n\n3. Third Sector: The National Trust (partners) are integrated into our research in several ways: attending out symposia (beginning and end of project); grass-roots involvement in the UK case studies; interviewed as part of our contextual overview on heritage organisations and climate change. They will share and disseminate findings through their organisation and networks. With our partners, the National Library of Wales and the Cornish Audio Visual Archive, we will co-develop methodologies for archiving the contemporary life that we encounter in our case studies. This will have long-term impact for NLW and CAVA, future researchers, and the documented communities. With a strong religious aspect to our research in Kiribati, we would target: Christian Aid, World Council of Churches, Forum on Religion and Ecology (FORE).\n\n4. Creative Collaborations: We have two direct non-HEI collaborations to create artistic work which can reach a broad international audience (i) Australian poet Mark Tredinnick will visit Kiribati, to write about 'place' in times of accelerated climate change; (ii) The PI will collaborate with Kiribati locals and sound-recordist Richard Gott to create short online films. Arts output will be publicised and disseminated by project collaborators: Cape Farewell and Welsh Literature Exchange, and will interest: New Welsh Review, Planet Magazine, Association for the Study of Literature and the Environment (ASLE), Centre for Contemporary Art and the Natural World (CCANW), RANE (Research in Art and Nature), and various literary publications.\n\n5. The media: We would contact Guardian online, Australia Network News online, OneClimate, The Kiribati Independent etc and local media at case-study sites (radio, newspapers, community newsletters.)", "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247", "text": "Cultural & museum studies", "percentage": 0}]}, "researchTopics": {"researchTopic": [{"id": "AD75E543-5F70-43C2-A40D-4452373465C4", "text": "Heritage Management", "percentage": 0}]}, "rcukProgrammes": {"rcukProgramme": []}, "start": null, "end": null, "participantValues": null}, {"links": {"link": [{"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/F7B9965A-ACE0-4692-B30C-0BE7AFB39F12", "rel": "PI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/746EBC23-24CA-4E06-A605-6C054F282028", "rel": "COI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/9C10D78F-6430-4CA7-9528-B96B0762A4C6", "rel": "LEAD_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/6FC41DDC-D184-4CC4-89F7-0DD68C966748", "rel": "COLLAB_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/4BA765CA-B8C3-421F-B756-168C9F553308", "rel": "COLLAB_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/6FB01F30-AAEE-4273-8A86-375DF838E213", "rel": "COLLAB_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/funds/C9DF8FC2-84BE-49BE-82AD-4A6F54CAAB2F", "rel": "FUND", "start": 1501542000000, "end": 1546214400000, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/collaborations/3D6E95D9-E83E-4D88-AFEF-E9A6BB39DED9", "rel": "COLLABORATION", "start": 1483228800000, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/collaborations/3B6CA9D9-6842-4055-ABE8-286A20AD283A", "rel": "COLLABORATION", "start": 1483228800000, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/collaborations/82E19BFA-D83C-4555-A2BB-EACF4C132CA2", "rel": "COLLABORATION", "start": 1483228800000, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/disseminations/226649DA-3E56-4541-985C-6380176B3A71", "rel": "DISSEMINATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}]}, "ext": null, "id": "DFE00A88-C8C3-49D6-A47F-A2B25083932E", "outcomeid": null, "href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/projects/DFE00A88-C8C3-49D6-A47F-A2B25083932E", "created": 1582643293000, "updated": null, "identifiers": {"identifier": [{"value": "AH/R000026/1", "type": "RCUK"}]}, "title": "Using a co-production method to engage with local history: linking Museums and local history Facebook groups.", "status": "Closed", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Sch of Social Sciences", "abstractText": "A co-design and co-creation project linking Museums with local history Facebook sites in the preservation and collection of local history.

historic buildings", "status": "Closed", "grantCategory": "Fellowship", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Anthropology", "abstractText": "Buildings change in response to various social processes and emerge through the different practices and understandings of people who use, inhabit and work on them. Over time structures acquire a range of meanings as authentic embodiments of the past, including values attached to original fabric, period features, and the patina of worn and weathered materials. Such understandings are associated with cultural, social and economic values that lend support to the importance of conserving and caring for old buildings. However these ideas have the potential to conflict with an increasing emphasis on energy-efficient renovation, entailing a radical transformation of the built environment in response to fears about climate change. Concretely, a range of measures including the installation of micro-generation technologies, insulation, new windows and the adoption of 'smart' technologies, all have the potential to improve the energy performance of older buildings, but also to compromise the historic value of existing structures.\n\nThis project examines how ideas about heritage conservation, a set of beliefs about the value of continuity and tradition, exist in relation to ideas about the need for environmentally motivated changes to a range of historic buildings. The project aims to understand the cultural meanings and social dynamics through which heritage and energy futures are constructed, through a study of the attitudes, values and beliefs of a range of building professionals and clients involved in renovation and retrofit. The project uses a mixture of methods, including interviewing and sustained detailed observation in relation to case-study buildings, combined with analysis of the broader discourses and cultural understandings that inform the positions of the professionals and clients involved. The findings will help understand how perceived conflicts between historic value and energy efficiency can be managed and will be used to shape policy and practice in an important but under-researched area.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "The aim of societal impact is integral to the project. Dialogue and dissemination activities with non-academic partnerships will leverage wider impact, including through targeted publications (see Pathways to Impact and Case for Support). Non-academic project partners, including representatives of leading public and private sector organisations in the areas of building conservation and energy, have pledged &pound;21,150 as in-kind contributions to the project (this figure excludes non-quantified contributions). This gives an indication of the wider potential of the societal and economic benefit of this research. \n\nThe main project beneficiaries will be:\n\n1) Conservation policy makers at national and international levels, who will be able to use the research to fill an important and pressing need for evidence-based policy in relation to sustainable heritage issues (see HS supporting statement). This will feed into ongoing policy reviews at Historic Scotland. Longer term wider impact will be achieved through activities identified via dialogue with stakeholders at the final project seminar.\n2) Conservation professionals who will benefit from improved understanding of the perspectives of building professionals and clients on heritage and energy (see supporting statements by Historic Scotland, Sustainable Traditional Buildings Alliance and the Institute for Historic Building Conservation). Project partners will benefit from knowledge gained via ongoing dialogue integral to the project, while wider benefits will be achieved through dissemination activities they have promised as in-kind contributions. \n3) Building professionals dealing with building renovation, including architects (see supporting statement by Institute for Historic Building Conservation, Millar Howard Workshop and the Scottish Civic Trust) and planners, who will benefit from improved understanding of attitudes to heritage and energy conservation among clients and the wider nexus of people involved in modificatons to historic buildings. \n4) Local Authorities who have to manage policies and programmes with conflicting aims and objectives in relation to heritage and energy conservation will benefit from improved evidence to use in decision making. Durham County Council, a project partner, have identified an absence of research on which to base their own policy and practice and have pointed to wider issues relating to the management of historic buildings by Local Authorities. Durham County Council will benefit directly through improved understanding as a result of dialogue and dissemination of research findings. Other Local Authorities, both nationally and internationally, will benefit from dissemination via Durham County Council and other project publications. \n5) Academic researchers in a range of disciplines will benefit from improved understanding of an area of important and emergent area of interest (see Academic Beneficiaries).\n6) The PI will benefit from research and career development to consolidate existing interests as a research leader in this field. This will enable him to benefit other researchers in the future through contributions to research, mentoring, teaching and support of other academics and students.\n7) The broader public will benefit in the longer-term via interventions to the built environment that effectively manage the tensions between heritage and energy conservation on the basis of improved understandings.", "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247", "text": "Cultural & museum studies", "percentage": 0}]}, "researchTopics": {"researchTopic": [{"id": "AD75E543-5F70-43C2-A40D-4452373465C4", "text": "Heritage Management", "percentage": 0}]}, "rcukProgrammes": {"rcukProgramme": []}, "start": null, "end": null, "participantValues": null}, {"links": {"link": [{"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/DE148A53-1474-41B6-858D-EDE1622C2762", "rel": "PI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/04A0D6D8-E833-4CEE-B2D0-075ADCC6DC90", "rel": "COI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/99E0872A-EDE5-4D59-8D8B-CA265267FEAA", "rel": "COI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/C842A34F-18F7-454D-A259-FED802368496", "rel": "LEAD_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/funds/E2A8746E-AFE0-459E-85FC-E227E7FD5BB1", "rel": "FUND", "start": 1329177600000, "end": 1358035200000, "otherAttributes": {}}]}, "ext": null, "id": "41C547BA-19FB-4E84-A2FA-EF1D98216643", "outcomeid": null, "href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/projects/41C547BA-19FB-4E84-A2FA-EF1D98216643", "created": 1582643293000, "updated": null, "identifiers": {"identifier": [{"value": "AH/J013676/1", "type": "RCUK"}]}, "title": "Building Shared Heritages: Cultural Diversity in Leicester", "status": "Closed", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Sch of Historical Studies", "abstractText": "The University of Leicester has a rich tradition of public engagement in its arts and humanities research. This award will facilitate the consolidation and of existing outreach and community engagement work to compliment the wider university drive to embed public engagement in its research strategy. The research skills held at Leicester in regards to heritage studies include, archaeology, urban history, museum studies, geography, English studies, and English local history. The public engagement work based in these disciplines is focused on diversity issues in terms of participation and access to resources, notably archival resources, oral history archives, and innovative methodologies that open up democratic access for communities to define and manage their heritage. Consequently, the University of Leicester is well situated to lead public engagement in the participation of community heritage. Its emphasis upon diversity in heritage studies is key indicators of a commitment to a civic and democratic framework to promote heritage within Leicester's diverse communities. This is represented in the CV's of the researchers involved in the application.\nThe City of Leicester provides a unique opportunity for researchers to build upon their existing public engagement work to include more diverse, hidden, and remote communities. The overarching heritage of Leicester's past fifty years is one of cultural diversity, marginality and exclusion. However, within this are questions over what constitutes valid objects of heritage, whose heritage they represent and how can multiple community heritage(s) exist around single instances of the built or natural environment without conflict; and the more timely question of who manages, maintains, and funds heritage in the community?\nThese questions will be explored over the course of the award through continued public engagement with local groups and community associations seeking to voice their ownership of local heritage and history. The award will enable researchers to coordinate community associations to identify common themes and concerns that can be mapped across existing networks of researchers and practitioners. This will facilitate a greater civic association between disconnected, marginalised, and remote community interests. The networking activity will be fermented by two open days to showcase research knowledge and skills, practitioner experience, governance expertise, and community heritage interests. In doing so the award will enable the University to diversify the user groups of its research base and impact upon their abilities to demonstrate an appreciation and governance of their heritage(s) and local histories. \nOne outcome of these open days will be to develop applications by the community associations for Heritage Lottery Funds. The open days and the ensuing networked collaboration will be structured by the three core themes of the HLF 'Your Heritage' programme; learning, conservation, and participation. These themes are embedded into the framework of the open days and continued engagement plans and are directed by the skills, knowledge, and expertise of the researchers involved and our partnership organisations, such as Leicester City Council, Groundwork UK, and English Heritage.\nIn addition to empowering community groups to apply to the HLF programme, the networks will enable researchers to develop innovative methodologies that can explore and conceptualise the specific, multiple, and intangible aspects of community heritage(s). This will lead to future research bids premised upon new partnerships that benefit from knowledge exchange and co-discovery. Ultimately, the award will enable the University of Leicester to take a lead role in promoting community heritage in our locality by strengthening its partnerships, research tradition, and impact in ways that benefit the public good - values that are at the core of the University's commitment to public engagement.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "The aims of the project are to enhance the university's public engagement capacities and to develop networks amongst local history and community heritage groups. Naturally, we regard impact as central to these aims, and will be explored through the four objectives. The impact of each of these objectives will be demonstrated through the following short, medium, and long-term activities:\nShort-Term: The award period will begin with the consolidation of existing researchers' activities working with a public engagement remit into an organised research network. These activities will enhance the legitimacy and visibility of public engagement in the university, where the impact will be felt within the research culture through the promotion of the aims of the NCCPE. The pathway to this impact will be through training opportunities provided by the Academic Development Unit, and through research networking at the College of Arts &amp; Humanities Research Seminars. The consolidation of an organised research network will enhance the capacity for impact not only in the short term, but also the medium to long-term. This will be due to the enhanced capacity at the university to engage with a greater diversity of community heritage groups, through the incorporation of a wide array of researcher interests. The capacity of this network will be demonstrated through the proposed initial outreach visits to four geographic locations in Leicester. This short-term impact will further be demonstrated in an online capacity through the establishment of a website linked to My Leicestershire and EMOHA websites. This will showcase promotional opportunities to further outreach beyond those groups already supporting this application.\nMedium-Term: the medium term impacts will occur across the award period, with the major pathways to impact being the two planned open days. This will lead to the creation of networks between associated community heritage groups, with the university in a bridging role between these and governance organisations such as Groundwork UK, English Heritage, and Leicester City Council. The impact of the open days will be guided by the HLF's themes of learn, conserve, and participate. These themes will provide the framework through which associative networking to disconnected individuals and groups will be achieved. The organisations and associations already supporting the bid have agreed to act as 'gatekeepers' to enable these opportunities. In short, the open days provide the major pathway to impact, as they will diversify access to university resources and heritage governance support for a range of marginalised and diverse community heritage groups. These activities will consolidate the links between the university, governance organisations, and community heritage groups through the development of HLF applications, which will not only fulfil one of the major aims of the award, but will provide the platform for continued engagement activities throughout the remainder of the award period.\nLong-Term: The longer term impacts will occur through the development of HLF bids by community heritage groups and will be facilitated by a range of online and offline activities. These include a continued engagement through the dedicated website set up early in the award period. This will enable guidance and further networking and broadcast opportunities for all the groups involved. A major academic impact as part of these activities will be the development of diversity issues within heritage studies. There will be long term impacts within the research culture at the University of Leicester, with researchers being able to apply for research council funding on the basis of co-discovery and knowledge exchange links demonstrated over the course of the award period. This will enable future research to develop academic and intellectual pursuits firmly grounded in public engagement with the importance of community heritage at centre-stage.", "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247", "text": "Cultural & museum studies", "percentage": 0}]}, "researchTopics": {"researchTopic": [{"id": "AD75E543-5F70-43C2-A40D-4452373465C4", "text": "Heritage Management", "percentage": 0}]}, "rcukProgrammes": {"rcukProgramme": []}, "start": null, "end": null, "participantValues": null}, {"links": {"link": [{"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/99E0872A-EDE5-4D59-8D8B-CA265267FEAA", "rel": "PI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/99E0872A-EDE5-4D59-8D8B-CA265267FEAA", "rel": "FELLOW_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/AE58F21F-3622-4382-97BB-1359BD183E9F", "rel": "LEAD_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/B477889C-FE62-4E88-BFB0-97C8A7383879", "rel": "COLLAB_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/AE58F21F-3622-4382-97BB-1359BD183E9F", "rel": "FELLOW_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/70EEB1A2-4E8C-45D6-881A-2DD01F8CE983", "rel": "PP_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/64750443-D2B4-4938-9EB5-1F568F29FB72", "rel": "PP_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/E7DA4F92-2718-4780-8254-21014258EA15", "rel": "PP_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/funds/ED144E00-B799-464C-9D0B-4F307866184C", "rel": "FUND", "start": 1501542000000, "end": 1588201200000, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/collaborations/694C2C3F-7651-4C9B-A1CF-BDEF627F5E67", "rel": "COLLABORATION", "start": 1483228800000, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/disseminations/88413023-7AEC-4DA8-93D2-295B84FC79BC", "rel": "DISSEMINATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/disseminations/88274896-6212-4B66-9730-D8849702DD59", "rel": "DISSEMINATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/disseminations/C3F6519F-9CAB-4ED0-B861-BABA696E2F42", "rel": "DISSEMINATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/disseminations/1B56890E-11D3-4E9C-938C-C0E7D93466C2", "rel": "DISSEMINATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/disseminations/79320F16-DFE8-43F4-8D09-23BFA243D7D9", "rel": "DISSEMINATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/disseminations/41BE1348-A309-493A-AC99-7B6EF4DABB56", "rel": "DISSEMINATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/impactsummaries/5B7CD5BD-D3E4-4791-8494-D012F8AB7482", "rel": "IMPACT_SUMMARY", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}]}, "ext": null, "id": "D3964845-54FF-411B-985A-A9A51037FBD6", "outcomeid": null, "href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/projects/D3964845-54FF-411B-985A-A9A51037FBD6", "created": 1582643293000, "updated": null, "identifiers": {"identifier": [{"value": "AH/P007058/1", "type": "RCUK"}]}, "title": "Why Does the Past Matter? Emotional Attachments to the Historic Urban Environment", "status": "Active", "grantCategory": "Fellowship", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "School of Social & Political Sciences", "abstractText": "The role of heritage within public policies has recently been elevated within both national and international contexts. The Scottish Government's strategy Our Place in Time began a process of &quot;mainstreaming the historic environment across national government policies&quot; (2014:13) whereas UNESCO's Historic Urban Landscapes approach (2011) was designed to integrate &quot;the goals of urban heritage conservation and those of social and economic development&quot; (2014:5). The potential for heritage to contribute to a range of agendas is therefore well recognised within public policy. However, despite this rhetoric there is still an acknowledgment that the heritage sector has not fully evidenced the reasons why the past matters to a range of individuals. This is clearly demonstrated by the Scottish Government, who within the same Strategy document, stated their need to &quot;improve our understanding of the role and impact the historic environment plays in all aspects of our lives - for example, its role in identity, well-being and sense of place&quot; (2014:15). This project sits firmly within this context as its central aim is to examine the range of factors that contribute to the development of emotional attachments between people and the historic urban environment and the extent to which these factors are considered within the designation and management of heritage in the UK. Contained within this context are three central research questions:\n\nRQ1: To what extent, and for what reasons, do changes to the urban environment expose emotional attachments between people and historic places?\n\nRQ2: In what ways, and for what reasons, do individuals express their emotional attachments to the historic urban environment during times of urban change?\n\nRQ3: To what extent, and how, are emotional attachments to place considered during the designation and management of historic urban assets?\n\nThe central core of the project engages with the emotional turn within heritage studies through conducting an analysis of the ways in which emotional attachments form between people and their historic urban environment. Previously described as the &quot;elephant in the room of heritage and museum studies&quot; (Smith and Campbell, 2016) emotion is increasingly becoming an influential theme within heritage studies. The project is premised on the belief that changes to urban environments can unlock previously latent emotional attachments to historic urban buildings. As such a number of urban case studies are examined through a combination of documents from privately held and rarely accessed archives, and newly-created data from place-based oral histories and focus groups. This existing and new data will then be subjected to analysis to try to examine the extent to which, and reasons why, the past matters to a range of individuals from heritage professionals to non-heritage professionals, defined as those people who are locally embedded within the historic urban environment, such as residents and activists.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact":

"leadOrganisationDepartment": "Pure and Applied Chemistry", "abstractText": "Experts in science (chemistry, physics, statistics), heritage science and sensor technology will drive an ambitious but realistic proposal to develop diagnostic olfactory tools for heritage science. The new devices will be non-invasive, non-contact, portable and simple to use providing real-time data; making them well suited to address cultural heritage questions and survey collections, particularly for objects where potential hazards, access issues or sampling restrictions have precluded study to date. Implementation of energy efficient sensors to tackle heritage problems (rather than large equipment) will also help reduce the U.K.'s environmental footprint. Indeed, there is an overall lack of capacity in the heritage sector both in organic material analysis and volatile organic compound (VOC) monitoring; this research addresses such issues.\\n\\nBy merely 'sniffing' the air, questions regarding the environmental and conservation history, composition, condition or stability of objects will be answered. This will empower collections custodians and allow informed decisions about the acquisition, storage, conservation, display and long-term preservation of items, whilst also ensuring the health of those accessing public and private collections. \\n\\nThree key interconnected challenges have been identified where timely research will give the UK a leading position providing new knowledge, expertise and technical developments, informing practitioners in heritage-user defined problem areas. \\n\\n1: The past use of hazardous chemicals to disinfect/disinfest objects presents risks to those handling or accessing objects. Within this challenge objects will be 'sniffed' to determine if they have undergone such treatments. The data will allow informed conservation /research decisions regarding handling, display, loan and access. Key deliverables include: improvement of scholarly, public and native community use and engagement with cultural heritage and collection preservation, and development of new knowledge data bases that will be used to train portable sensing systems designed for high-throughput object screening.\\n\\n2: Since the beginning of last century observation and analyses have established that paper is unstable. A by-product of the deterioration process is the production of VOCs. In this challenge a well characterized set of papers will be 'sniffed' to identify target indicators that imply paper instability. A key deliverable will be the development and application of non-invasive portable sampling tools for paper-based collections that can be used to provide rapid on-site analysis of stability and risk. \\n\\n3: Heritage institutions are continually acquiring objects that contain synthetic, complex and inherently unstable modern materials. The composition and condition of such objects are extremely difficult to characterise and assess. A unique approach will be taken to tackle this problem: measurement of VOCs emitted by modern materials. The data will be used to inform heritage users of object composition and materials instability; interpretation of 'object smell' has not previously been exploited in this way. A key deliverable is development of a new tool for the identification of modern materials at risk allowing mitigation methods to be implemented to retard chemical and/or biological deterioration.\\n\\nThis proposal therefore seeks to develop VOC sampling tools to address these challenges without the need for complex or costly instrumentation. Indeed very few heritage institutions have access to laboratory equipment and such studies are impossible to implement. The outcome of this research (development of hand held portable low cost sensors) will be of wide benefit to heritage-users and open the research door to thousands of smaller institutions (museums, galleries, libraries, historic houses) and private collectors.\\n", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "The outputs of this multi/interdisciplinary research project will create a positive and considerable impact on a diverse group of beneficiaries. Data, generated in all research challenges will benefit the heritage sector by providing fundamental knowledge that can be applied to better understand cultural heritage collections (composition, construction and condition) and improve the ability to interpret, represent and preserve such collections. Understanding of environmental impact and deterioration mechanisms will be improved and curators, conservators and applied scientists will use the information to create methods of analysis, develop treatments, modify existing conservation practice (storage, design) and access arrangements. Such objectives will be achieved within 1 - 5 years of published research outputs. Heritage sector partners will ensure sector dissemination and relevance. The developing sensing systems, designed to 'sniff' and interpret emission profiles, will also benefit academics and industrial partners working in sensor technology. Staff, scholars and the public, interacting with cultural heritage objects, will benefit as VOC monitoring will identify environments with the potential to cause ill-health and lead guidance for handling and access based on assessment of risk. The heritage science sector will benefit immediately by increasing capacity in VOC research and providing staff with the required multidisciplinary training for contribution to UK heritage science research. \\n\\nThe sensing systems proposed are small, low cost and portable allowing on-site analysis and interpretation without the need for expensive, complex laboratory equipment. Therefore the research will not only impact upon universities/large institutions but will permit research in smaller, local institutions facing similar problems (see Case for Support) but without resources to tackle them. Thus people not normally engaged in research will better understand their collections by assessing stability and estimating risk; dissemination, training and outreach activities will be required to deliver this medium term (5-10 years) objective.\\n\\nLonger term, the accumulated emission profiles and analyte specific concentration data, will inform other sectors, such as the food industry (pesticide screening), healthcare (breath diagnostics) and security (detection of compounds with low vapour pressures). The research outputs will also have a direct social and future political impact with regard to the composition/ concentration of compounds in the air we breathe. To reduce the UK's carbon footprint government legislation is driving the construction/building industries to provide more airtight homes. However indoor generated pollutants (similar to those found in heritage science where this practice is mirrored in new storage/display design) then build up to levels potentially deleterious to health. The emission profiles, VOC data and sensor developments in this proposal will directly impact on this future area of concern.\\n\\nAttracting UK and international visitors to heritage partners is vital to UK cultural life and economy (via tourism). The idea of 'smell' and advanced analytical tools make this research particularly valuable in increasing public engagement with heritage and science thus improving communication and mutual understanding.\\n\\nImpact will be facilitated by the communications/engagement plans for both specialists and the public (see Impact Plan). Assistance from the Sensor and Instrumentation KTN and presentations at international events (chemistry, physics, spectroscopy, sensors, environmental) will ensure transfer of information across sectors out with heritage science. VOC training workshops will be given at the UoS whilst public interaction will be encouraged at the BM workshop.

Application to Al-Ashraf Street.", "status": "Active", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Civil & Environmental Engineering", "abstractText": "Egypt is very rich with archaeological sites. These sites contribute significantly to the tourism industry which is one of the main income sources for the Egyptian economy. However, the management and conservation of these sites is a challenging task due to the ever-increasing threats such as population growth, urbanization, pollution, natural hazards, among others. These threats result in the gradual deterioration of these sites, and hence results in significant economic losses. \nInterdisciplinary management is fundamental to the conservation of these sites, particularly when dealing with large areas such as Historic Cairo which contains more than 600 listed historical structures. Unfortunately, however, Historic Cairo suffers from the following: 1) deterioration of its historical structures at an alarming rate; 2) poor site management; 3) disempowerment of local communities, thus depriving them of their role as main stakeholders and beneficiaries of heritage; 4) deteriorated infrastructure resulting in decrease in quality of life and hampering socio-economic growth; 5) rising of groundwater level inside historical structures; 6) absence of plans for waste management; 7) poor security and safeguard of heritage sites resulting in trespassing on historical structures by misuse, demolition, wrong restorations, illegal construction activities, and so forth; 8) lack of studies related to structural assessment, safety evaluation and health monitoring of its historical structures; and finally 9) absence of plans for adaptive re-use of historical structures after restoration. \nAll these problems are epitomized in Al-Ashraf street and its historical structures which makes it an ideal choice for the application of this study. The street is about 600m long starting near to Al-Sayeda Nafisa square and ending at the intersection with Ahmed Ibn Tolon street. It contains 8 historical structures dating back mainly to the Fatimid (969-1171) and Mamluk (1250-1517) periods and constructed primarily from stone and brick masonry; among them are the Domes of Al-Ashraf Khalil, Fatma Khatun and Shajar Al-Durr. In specific, the two domes of Al-Ashraf Khalil and Fatma Khatun are suffering from a series problems that may lead to their total loss if no action plans would be taken to conserve them.\nThe research proposed in this project will be highly complementary to previous studies carried out for the conservation of Historic Cairo. In 2010, the URHC (Urban Regeneration of Historic Cairo) (urhcproject.org) was launched by the UNESCO-WHC to assist the Egyptian government in the management of the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Historic Cairo. The URHC project, which was completed in 2014, was concerned with the whole of Historic Cairo. Its wide and overarching scale therefore did not enable detailed studies such as those related to groundwater studies, structural aspects, health monitoring and specific conservation plans, which are all dealt with in this proposal, to be addressed. In contrast, aspects such crafts, violations after the revolution of 25 January 2011, housing rehabilitations, are not given primary focus in this proposal. The proposed research will however make direct use of the findings and recommendations of the URHC study, particularly in terms of using GIS as a management tool, conducting surveys on the local population, and addressing the problem of waste management. Importantly, focusing on only one street within Historic Cairo will enable detailed conservation and intervention methodologies which incorporate disaggregated structural, groundwater, waste management and community-specific solutions to be developed.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "Egypt has a large number of historical sites distributed all over the country, among them seven UNESCO world heritage sites. Historic Cairo is one of the most well-known and visited sites within these. The tourism industry heavily depends on these historical sites in many ways. They represent a primary source of income to a significant proportion of the population directly by supporting the following jobs: hotel staff, travel agents, airlines staff, tour guides, souvenir shop keepers, street vendors, entertainers, as well as administrative and maintenance workers on the various sites. Tourism-related employed people are mostly living in poverty around the tourism hotspots to be able to commute easily to their work. The fall in tourism, from 2011 till now, has led to serious breakdown of conservation and maintenance activities which were partially funded from ticket sale and revenue. In addition, the lack of appropriate management plans of historical sites leads to bottle necks in the rise of tourism. Therefore, the current research will synergise with current government and NGO efforts to add Al-Ashraf Street (and its surrounding zone of al-Khalifa) to the cultural tourism map.\nThe proposed research investigations will offer key decision makers, represented in the Ministry of Antiquities and Cairo Governorate, the developed techniques and methodologies within the outcome of this project. This will be achieved through close cooperation with Megawra which has been active in the neighbourhood since 2012 and has an MoU with Cairo Governorate for collaboration on the development and upgrade of Historic Cairo as well as an agreement with the Ministry of Antiquities for the studies of the archaeological conservation of the Domes of Fatima Khatun and al-Ashraf Khalil.\nThe Ministry of Tourism (Egypt) and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (UK) will be other beneficiaries of the proposed research. The outputs from the project will be transferred to the public, as well as national and international media via websites, newspapers articles, posters, and others, to publicise developments. The increase in the number of local and international visitors to Al-Ashraf Street and the surrounding area of Historic Cairo will be an indicator of the positive impact of the project.\nThere will also be of added value to The Ministry of Scientific Research (Egypt), and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (UK). Scientific projects related to the conservation of Egyptian and UK historical sites are of vital importance. This project will therefore contribute to a key research field and will transfer knowledge related to the management and conservation of historical sites, and particularly in its application in dilapidated sites in developing countries. This project will put Al-Ashraf Street (and its surrounding zone of al-Khalifa ) on the academic maps as a subject for research. As well, it will add new much-needed researchers to the Athar Lina initiative network who representing research fields and countries that are not represented. This project would also help stimulate research on other historical sites, and the increase in the number of such projects may be used in future as an indicator of the positive impact of the project. \nOther stakeholders include the Departments of Conservation of Monuments and Historical Sites, and Islamic Architectural Studies, in the Faculties of Archaeology and the Departments of Architecture, Urban Planning, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Structural Engineering, and Hydrology in Egypt. \nThe initiation of this project would also ultimately instigate closer collaboration between Cairo University and Imperial College London, in terms of research and education, as well as with the Ministries of Antiquities and of Scientific Research in Egypt and their UK counterparts, together with community-led and societal organisations, in order to promote cooperation in this field.", "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247", "text": "Cultural & museum studies", "percentage": 0}, {"id": "895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10", "text": "RCUK Programmes", "percentage": 0}, {"id": "C087E953-30F3-4968-B0F3-D48A5998A2B4", "text": "Civil eng. & built environment", "percentage": 0}]}, "researchTopics": {"researchTopic": [{"id": "153EEBDB-0E76-4210-9687-2E4C43AE8DFF", "text": "Structural Engineering", "percentage": 0}, {"id": "AD75E543-5F70-43C2-A40D-4452373465C4", "text": "Heritage Management", "percentage": 0}]}, "rcukProgrammes": {"rcukProgramme": [{"id": "C11BDEA9-7D9D-4728-B6A9-31032921B328", "text": "Newton", "percentage": 0}]}, "start": null, "end": null, "participantValues": null}, {"links": {"link": [{"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/D7B0E66F-265D-4ADB-A6CD-25CF76F0E441", "rel": "PI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/3A5E126D-C175-4730-9B7B-E6D8CF447F83", "rel": "LEAD_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C", "rel": "COFUND_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/C28FFEA8-F35F-4404-9EDD-E736BEEF12C7", "rel": "PP_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/funds/7810E7D3-E5C4-4900-952A-CD3A4184FF14", "rel": "FUND", "start": 1272668400000, "end": 1367276400000, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/disseminations/8BC17568-F937-4956-BFFB-20369A55B1B9", "rel": "DISSEMINATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/A0DCFA03-6E41-48AA-ACB3-D4C450929779", "rel": "PUBLICATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/59FCC2DF-9092-4899-A060-CF0F13E32466", "rel": "PUBLICATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/384A344B-76D0-47D7-9989-908EDD48E892", "rel": "PUBLICATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}]}, "ext": null, "id": "C4438D55-FB5F-4970-93F1-572CFAEB6911", "outcomeid": null, "href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/projects/C4438D55-FB5F-4970-93F1-572CFAEB6911", "created": 1582643293000, "updated": null, "identifiers": {"identifier": [{"value": "AH/H032266/1", "type": "RCUK"}]}, "title": "Change or Damage? Effect of Climate on Decorative Furniture Surfaces in Historic Properties", "status": "Closed", "grantCategory": "Fellowship", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Bartlett Sch of Graduate Studies", "abstractText": "Within historic houses furniture surfaces are often richly decorated which can lead to an increased risk of damage due to the different environmental responses of materials. These composite objects are extremely difficult to study and a systematic work assessing the damage caused by changing humidity and by exposure to light still needs to be performed and is the focus of this proposal. With wood having been assessed as the second most damaged material in English Heritage collections, a number of curatorial questions arise, which need to be answered in an interdisciplinary context. The management of furniture collections, particularly decorative surfaces which are extremely costly to perform conservation interventions on, could become even more difficult due to climate change.\\n\\nAlthough these objects are well known to be at a great risk of damage, the unanswered questions are still very fundamental. How dry does the environment need to be for damage to occur? How fast does damage occur? How long does it have to be dry for damage to occur? There are also questions about what constitutes damage. Understanding how conservators, curators and the public feel about these questions can also inform decisions about how to manage and care for the collection and its display environment. Intensive cooperation with English Heritage curators and interpretation officers is therefore planned to answer these questions.\\n\\nExperimental, as well as in situ research will be carried out in order to understand the effect of the display environment. Since small changes are difficult to measure, sensitive equipment is required in situ. The impact of modern scientific equipment within a historic interior also has to be assessed. After the sensitivity of objects to the environment is modelled, the integration of these models with environmental modelling will be attempted. This will allow for examination of various scenarios, informed by climate change predictions.\\n\\nThe outcomes of the project will be intensively disseminated, however, to increase project impact, studies will be performed on how to integrate the new knowledge on the sensitivity of decorated surfaces into heritage management practices, standards and guidelines.\\n", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "The research will benefit policy-makers, including both British (BSI) and European (CEN) standards and public sector organisations, including project partner English Heritage, by identifying adverse environmental conditions, at which the risk of damage is unacceptable, for furniture collections with decorative furniture surfaces. Representatives from these groups agreed to become members of the Advisory Board, in order to maximise project impact. \\n\\nThe impact will be further strengthened through publications, presentations and the conference reporting the results and helping improve management practices. The results may also help develop loan conditions and standards for these collections similar to those for paintings by the Bizot group of museum directors.\\n\\nThe definition of damage for these collections and the production of environmental models predicting their behaviour into the future will benefit international conservation groups (e.g. ICOM-CC and IIC) as well as UK professional and practice groups (e.g. ICON). It will also be relevant to furniture manufacturers, private conservators and furniture restorers, but particularly to furniture collection managers helping them to reduce the costs of furniture conservation and restoration. To ensure these groups benefit fully the project will be communicated via journals published by and presentations at conferences organised by the professional bodies. The website, video and final conference will also be available to provide further details. The project will also be disseminated through the Net Heritage EU project, particularly through its Heritage Observatory.\\n\\nMuseums, galleries, heritage organisations (e.g. National Trust) and private historic house owners will benefit from the proposed research as a result of the improved understanding and management of these collections. The thresholds and damage functions, as well as informing standards, and improved management practices will give greater awareness of the care of the collections. The damage seminar and definition of damage for these collections will help elucidate curators, conservators and scientists' opinions. Publication of these details and definitions will also inform risk assessments of collections. To ensure the impact is maximised the research will published in journals and presented at both UK and international conferences, as well as at the project conference.\\n\\nTours of Kenwood House and the exhibition on the project will inform visitors and the home and antiques media about the research.

Additionally in mapping and addressing the issues pertaining to the neglected historic gardens along the river front it attempts to bring the river, the river edge and its associated natural and cultural ecologies back into the lives of the larger population of Agra. \n\nThe city of Agra is synonymous with Mughal history and Mughal architecture and as such is a major draw for tourism. However, the economic benefits of tourism are only being enjoyed by a select few, with few trickle down benefits. While the city has grown in all directions, it has turned its back to the river and the built and landscape heritage on its banks, even as the major landmarks like the Taj Mahal and Agra Fort stand out as exceptions. Some of the surviving Mughal gardens, besides being tourist spots, continue to give respite to the people of Agra, as the green lung of the city. The river edge has also changed its character from that of an elite area to one housing the poor and the marginalized in large pockets. The existence of these historic gardens, and attempts at their conservation, offer a unique opportunity to not only help reconnect the riverfront to the city, but also through community driven conservation proposals which engage the communities with the heritage surrounding them, can provide livelihood opportunities, which in turn would improve the quality of life and habitat of the communities residing in these areas. \n\nThe project proposes to bring together academics, researchers, practitioners and representatives from NGOs and local government organisations to:\n- Establish ways in which community led urban conservation projects can be initiated in the India context, identify challenges and opportunities (workshop 1);\n- Develop methodologies for gathering/understanding values from local communities and other stakeholders (workshop 1)\n- Test these methodologies on a 'live' pilot project in Agra (action-research), using postgraduate students from the School of Planning and Architecture, Delhi and Oxford Brookes University (live project field work)\n- Working with the students in a shared and collaborative project, develop regeneration project proposals for the area that considers the rehabilitation and conservation of the architectural heritage, the revitalisation of urban spaces and in particular the waterfront, and considers the feasibility of the project and the social and economic benefits it can bring to the communities, locality and the city (live project, internal workshops at the Universities)\n- Through a series of locally organised events including exhibitions, public participatory workshops and presentations engage a range of stakeholders in recognising the potential for caring for the heritage and engaging with the processes that can achieve results (workshop 2 and dissemination event)\n- Demonstrate to the city authorities and other potential donors the potential and value of the historic environment in the urban regeneration process (dissemination)", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "Alongside academic beneficiaries, the six month research network project and its outcomes will be of interest and relevance to: \n\n1. Third sector organisations will directly benefit from the process of community engagement to influence future developmental work in Agra's riverfront neighbourhoods. Project outputs produced by the students will provide materials for local NGOs to continue their engagement with local communities, public sector authorities and critically funding bodies. Other third sector organisations operating in Agra and India can also benefit from the approaches utilised and the outcomes of this project \n\n2. Public sector beneficiaries in Agra (and elsewhere) and particularly those responsible for heritage conservation, urban planning, economic development and tourism development will benefit through participation in the project and discover the potential for urban conservation and regeneration of the historic riverfront areas in the public good and as a resource for economic development.\n\n3. Local community beneficiaries, the residents of the neighbourhoods directly involved in the project will benefit from public engagement activities, and in the longer term improved quality of life and extended economic and livelihood opportunities. Through engagement and participatory approaches the project will enable local communities to discover the heritage values of their neighbourhood as well as give them a voice to express the tangible and intangible values they associate with their locality.\n\n4. The general public: through attending an open public exhibition through social media and the local press, will learn about the forgotten heritage of the river front, the heritage values of the local community including intangible heritage. This will raise awareness of heritage and contribute to a sense of pride and place identity, leading to greater public interest in the protection of heritage. \n\n5. Practitioners working in urban conservation and engaging in participatory approaches will benefit from the lessons learned during the process to inform future projects.\n\n6. Post-graduate students and teachers by participating in the pilot project will gain (transferable) skills in field research, community engagement and working in multi-disciplinary groups in a multi-cultural environment. The skills and awareness for community-led initiatives in the protection and celebration of cultural heritage gained during the project could potentially inform their future practice perspective and passed onto others. \n\n7.

"Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Bartlett Sch of Graduate Studies", "abstractText": "Collections of heritage objects have a specifically dynamic evolution: they constantly grow and constantly degrade depending on use, environment and material properties. Understanding of this dynamics is currently lacking, yet it could significantly optimise of collection management. To achieve this, the project poses several fundamental research questions: \\n- How to explain collections as dynamic populations? \\n- What is the relationship between an object and a group of objects (collection)? \\n- How to describe the demographics (changes in a population over time) of collections in relation to age, use, environmental influences and values we attach to heritage? \\nSignificant reference points in an object's life need to be defined, particularly the 'point of failure', therefore, a philosophical framework defining (un)acceptable levels of damage is necessary. Given the extent of knowledge and existing data collected in the last decade for paper-based objects, this project will largely focus on library and archival collections. \\nDemographic statistical tools will be exploited to model changes in populations of objects. The established functions of change based on agents such as environment, use and inherent properties of objects will be overlaid on existing and new collections survey data (census data). The main output, the demographic model will be informed and interpreted through an overarching framework of cultural values. This management tool will, therefore, be based on a holistic understanding of the value of collections.\\nThe Collection Demography proposal is ideally nested within the theme Nature of Transformation. Beside focussing on material agents of change, the proposal principally examines the transformation of cultural values over time and addresses the culturally-driven question with scientific tools. Appropriate computational tools will be developed to interpret the demography of historic collections. Exploration of the effects of environmental change on collections also addresses the Resilience and Adaptation theme. Despite the project's focus on archival and library collections, the outcomes of this research project will have application to all cultural heritage collections. The rich interdisciplinarity arising from the collaboration of art historians, conservators, heritage managers, environmental, building and material scientists, and statisticians strongly supports the goals of the Science and Heritage Programme. The cooperation between the higher and non-education sectors will help to diminish sector fragmentation and build the much needed capacity in full alignment with the Programme goals.\\nThe wider relevance of the project has been stressed at many recent fora: 62 expert participants in the Science &amp; Heritage Programme Research Cluster 'Environmental Guidelines: Opportunities or Risks' (EGOR) strongly stressed the need for tools integrating the relationships between people, collections and environment. The project will also provide arguments in the BSI/CEN debates on new environmental standards and guidelines. The CATCH22 Cluster (Cultural Encounters and Explorations) was largely based on debates linking change and damage as an issue still widely unknown.\\nA number of facilitated public and expert engagement workshops are planned to explore the values attached to objects and collections. Dissemination is planned through two international workshops, refereed publications posters, interactive project website with video information and printed materials. The collaborating partners will organise an international conference on value, material and environmental change in relation to heritage collections. The heritage partners will also review their collection management policies in line with project outputs.\\nThe project partners are UCL Centre for Sustainable Heritage, University of East Anglia, UCL Department of Statistics, The national Archives (UK), English Heritage and The Library of Congress (USA).", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "The Collections Demography project is extremely end-user oriented and will undoubtedly influence internal management policies in major partner heritage organisations: The National Archives (UK), English Heritage and the Library of Congress (USA). This will ensure that the project outcomes are taken up by heritage organisations and thus a global impact on heritage management will be achieved and the quality of access to heritage improved. As well as immediate benefits, long-term impacts can also be foreseen: \\n- New interdisciplinary research communities. The pronounced interdisciplinarity of the project will set a new paradigm in heritage science and influence practitioner communities, policy makers, conservation professionals, and managers of cultural heritage collections.\\n- Impact on the Science and Heritage Programme. The project will have a strong impact on the Programme through capacity building: the strong collaboration between higher education sector and heritage sector institutions, including international institutions, promises the fragmentation to be overcome.\\n- Science and Heritage Programme legacy. The project will build over and above the outcomes of two Collaborative Research Studentships, and thus represent an early example of the importance and influence of the research supported by the Programme.\\n- Impact on internal policies. The heritage partners will, on the basis of project outcomes, review their internal collection management policies. This will set an example for other heritage end-users.\\n- Impact on standards and guidelines. The developed model will enable a review of the existing environmental and material management standards and guidelines to be undertaken, as it will provide arguments on benefits of particular management options.\\n- Knowledge transfer. The project will have a strong impact on the practitioner communities, as it aligns with research agendas of S&amp;H Research Clusters Catch 22, and EGOR: Environmental Guidelines Opportunities or Risks and will take further the outcomes of these Clusters particularly in the areas of environmental management and the public understanding of managing cultural heritage collections.\\n- Improving the quality of public services. Through better management, better access to heritage collections will be enabled thus improving the quality of public services.\\n- Improving the quality of life. There has been considerable discussion in recent times of how in our target driven culture one can ensure excellence in the cultural heritage sector. The improved understanding of the relationship of cultural heritage and improving quality of life has been the subject of much debate in recent years. \\n- Improving economic performance. Through optimised collection management, including management of the environment, the energy demands for storage and access may well be decreased and thus the economic and energy performance of buildings housing heritage collections significantly improved. This may have important economic consequences, particularly taking into account climate change predictions in the long term.\\n- Business opportunities. The climate and pollution predictions may require more comprehensive environmental monitoring in the future, including monitoring of pollutants, which can presently not be monitored due to the non-availability of appropriate sensors. The project may underpin new developments in the sensors and monitoring industry.", "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247", "text": "Cultural & museum studies", "percentage": 0}]}, "researchTopics": {"researchTopic": [{"id": "AD75E543-5F70-43C2-A40D-4452373465C4", "text": "Heritage Management", "percentage": 0}, {"id": "87271198-220A-4031-BC9F-FD8E133AB3C8", "text": "Conservation Science", "percentage": 0}]}, "rcukProgrammes": {"rcukProgramme": []}, "start": null, "end": null, "participantValues": null}, {"links": {"link": [{"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/ABEBFDC5-6476-4192-AD4A-B8E15BA6DF7A", "rel": "PI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/3A5E126D-C175-4730-9B7B-E6D8CF447F83", "rel": "LEAD_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/5C316DE6-985E-404A-8926-C2A63A7A1E64", "rel": "COLLAB_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C", "rel": "COFUND_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/C28FFEA8-F35F-4404-9EDD-E736BEEF12C7", "rel": "PP_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/funds/EE4BDB27-D2C6-4759-BE59-041A2C14DCB8", "rel": "FUND", "start": 1275346800000, "end": 1369954800000, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/collaborations/B79F05E4-644A-49FD-B739-604FAC0F86EC", "rel": "COLLABORATION", "start": 1262304000000, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/disseminations/05981237-E4DD-4315-9ADD-EC53C9211E63", "rel": "DISSEMINATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/disseminations/C1C75B51-8AE1-45C0-9A38-64B99820168B", "rel": "DISSEMINATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/disseminations/DFE7E651-8D2B-4A38-A5AD-E4B083EE8C44", "rel": "DISSEMINATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/disseminations/CF26DAA4-ED78-4A15-B521-8D56E574A261", "rel": "DISSEMINATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/furtherfundings/7F754CF0-70A0-4555-9C05-AEA9A6F8AD1E", "rel": "FURTHER_FUNDING", "start": 1377990000000, "end": 1406934000000, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/researchdatabaseandmodels/D4483FA6-EB23-495D-B43E-0905AAAEAD60", "rel": "RESEARCH_DATABASE_AND_MODEL", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/softwareandtechnicalproducts/50DA13A2-5963-4FAE-B24E-49FE04E906BA", "rel": "SOFTWARE_AND_TECHNICAL_PRODUCT", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/DC033947-B3AB-4C7B-BA34-7B125B285744", "rel": "PUBLICATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/D155F7FF-6378-443E-A9B0-1F3C77626D76", "rel": "PUBLICATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/1015DA52-439C-4393-85E3-5999C31CD6CD", "rel": "PUBLICATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/D896341B-F138-44F1-994A-FDEC7D7AB2F6", "rel": "PUBLICATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}]}, "ext": null, "id": "977380FC-1091-4191-BEB3-4C27A8A4666E", "outcomeid": null, "href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/projects/977380FC-1091-4191-BEB3-4C27A8A4666E", "created": 1582643293000, "updated": null, "identifiers": {"identifier": [{"value": "AH/H032126/1", "type": "RCUK"}]}, "title": "ACCESSIBLE HERITAGE -

Remote trans-continental heritage support system' aims to develop and deploy on heritage sites a wireless network of long-life and remote environmental monitoring devices and to develop an associated policy framework promoting local data ownership. \\nIn line with the hybrid nature of the project, innovation is on several levels: from a technical point of view, the project will ensure the durability of sensor arrays and their sensitivity to principal ambient pollutants, which has not been achieved before in heritage monitoring. From the point of view of heritage management, one of the principal innovations of the project will be the way how data are owned, accessed, and fed into heritage site management plans. This research will be done in collaboration with the English Heritage partner. Thus, there is clear innovation from the scientific point of view, which is led by heritage questions.\\nThe experimental development will include the design and calibration of sensors arrays, including modification to enable direct monitoring of pollutants and climate data. In parallel, a wireless communication device will be developed with a microcontroller to sample the signals and to control the radio communications. A communication protocol to collect sensor data from local devices into a gateway or sink device will be developed, which will feed the data onto the web. The updated sensor data, as well as the history of collected data from several heritage sites across three continents will be available globally on the project website, designed in collaboration with heritage partners.\\nThe deployments are scheduled within the three year duration of the fellowship programme. The selected sites are in UK, Africa and Asia in collaboration with English Heritage and UNESCO. The availability of such data will enable us to monitor and analyse the heritage climate and to implement the findings in view of the threats imposed by climate change. There is a real potential for the network to grow beyond the lifetime of the project thus maximising its impact and legacy of the programme. \\nThe project host organisation is University College London (UCL) with three collaborating departments: UCL Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering and UCL London Centre for Nanotechnology, while the project will be based at UCL Centre for Sustainable Heritage. The project partners include English Heritage, which will play a key role in issues related to policy development, data ownership and access to data, especially in the international context.

For such an ambitious impact plan to be successful, partnerships with managing governments and international institutions are an essential requirement. This is why partnerships with UNESCO, English Heritage and the Government of the Republic of Benin are so important. They provide the assurance that the proposed technological development takes into account the end-user view and that the collected data are not only available, but correctly managed, locally owned, and globally accessible. The proposed development of the polycy framework promoting data collection and local ownership while enabling its sharing, will ensure that the new developments are taken up. The project can contribute to UK competitiveness by exploiting the potential IPR ramifications and commercial usage of the proposed technology at the end of the Fellowship period. Politically, such a British-led research effort to provide a global database of environmental conditions on world heritage can only reinforce UK international leadership on environmental and heritage issues.\\n\\nEngagement of Users and Beneficiaries\\nThe fellowship holder will be responsible for managing and coordinating the working relations between the different partners and the multidisciplinary Advisory Board. The latter is composed of representatives from partner institutions including English Heritage, UNESCO, UCL Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering and UCL London Centre for Nanotechnology. \\nIn order to secure the impact, the project had to engage a variety of users and beneficiaries already in the planning phase.

One of the project's leaders, Professor Michael Wilson, writes that 'a study of sport opens the window onto the social history of the age'[1], a fitting testament to the new Museum of Welsh Cricket opening shortly at Cardiff's SWALEC Stadium. The project coincided with Cardiff's hosting of the England-Australia Test match and celebrates the rich cultural gains that cricket offers both players and community members alike. Cardiff's role as host makes for pertinent research into the evolving relationship between a sport and its fans and 'TaleEnders' is a project that aims to commemorate Wales' oral cricketing heritage and make it accessible to the wider community. \\n\\nWith this in mind recent American Studies and Geography graduate Sophie Leslie, under the supervision of Professor Mike Wilson, collated stories and memories from six diverse Welsh clubs ranging from players to tea ladies to groundsmen, and collected their testimonies in the forms of video interviews, audio interviews, written accounts and digital stories. The team also built up a photographic record of Welsh club cricket from the late nineteenth century right up to the present day and put it into the public domain of Flickr.com. 'TaleEnders' was driven by the understanding that everybody has a story to tell, and that one story invariably leads on to another. To this end researchers approached people directly and displayed their findings digitally, both at the museum and online. It encouraged direct personal responses and ensured an organic evolution to the greater 'story'. 'TaleEnders' not only benefited the wider community but involved it, and continues to do so by encouraging new stories and comments.\\n\\nThrough 'TaleEnders' Wales has become more aware of its close personal ties with Glemorgan Cricket Club and has a wider appreciation for the community aspect of sport. There are plans for six more cricket clubs to get involved next year, future Knowledge Transfer links to be established, an online training programme to be set up along with tools for self-archiving and co-curating to ensure that the project continues to evolve.\\n", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": null, "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities":

Latin inscriptions, which it has accumulated over the centuries since 1683. The core of the collection consists of the Arundel marbles, but the museum has made further acquisitions since the seventeenth century, most recently of inscriptions from the estate of the late Sir Howard Colvin. The main publication of the collection is that of Chandler (1763), who included the 134 inscriptions then owned by the museum. No modern edition of the collection exists. No photographic record of the inscriptions has ever been published. The inscriptions originate from Britain and other parts of the Roman world and date from the late Republic down to mediaeval times. The collection includes a wide range of types of inscriptions: many are monumental inscriptions such as epitaphs, religious dedications, and commemorative building-inscriptions, but many more are inscribed upon everyday objects, including pewterware, pottery, and even a set of panpipes. None of the inscriptions on its own is of any especial historical consequence, but together they offer insights into the Roman world, its commemorative habits, social hierarchy, economic networks, and uses of literacy. Specifically too, the place of the frontier province of Britain within the cultural, social, religious, and economic networks of the wider Roman empire can be illustrated by the inscriptions found there.\nDespite the fact that they offer a direct line of communication with the ancient world, Latin inscriptions seem inaccessible and incomprehensible to the general public. This project aims to create an online corpus and critical edition of the museum's collection of inscriptions for a scholarly readership, and then to use this as a springboard for further online resources and interactive activities, and to incorporate more Latin inscriptions into the museum's displays in order to open up this type of first-hand source material to as wide an audience as possible. It will show how Latin inscriptions can illuminate the society, economy, and religion of the past, and will explore the ways in which Latin continued to be used in Britain even after the end of 'Roman Britain'.\nAs well as containing a research core relating to Roman history and to the history of collections and museums, this project will make a valuable contribution to understanding better how digital resources can be embedded into different contexts peopled by professional scholars, students, teachers, schoolchildren, &amp; museum-visitors. The AHRC has been at the forefront of funding innovative digital epigraphic projects, such as Inscriptions of Aphrodisias &amp; MAMA XI, and of supporting new imaging techniques via the project e-Science and Ancient Documents. These projects have clearly demonstrated the advantages of publication in EpiDoc XML, but we wish to explore this potential further in several ways: by exploring the integration of an EpiDoc corpus into a Museum's cataloguing system; by discovering how it can be used to enhance current displays within the Museum; by seeing how the XML can be used to produce teaching resources for use by institutions elsewhere. In particular, it will seek to put into practice the potential in EpiDoc to produce resources suitable for the visually impaired.\nSeveral audiences will be the potential beneficiaries of this project. Visitors to the museum will be able to engage more easily with the Latin inscriptions on display; interactive activities will target schoolchildren. Schools will be able to use new online resources in the Education Centre during their visits to the museum and to engage in follow-up activities afterwards. Students and scholars will be able to access the electronic EpiDoc corpus of the inscriptions. By publishing an electronic corpus, the museum's collection will be made accessible to a worldwide audience, and it will be possible to integrate its data into the existing major online databases of Latin inscriptions.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "The impact of this project beyond academia is potentially huge, involving the museum-visiting public resident in the UK, foreign visitors, schoolchildren, and students. The Ashmolean Museum itself will of course benefit from engaging a wide audience in another element of its extensive collections. Exploring new ways of displaying Latin inscriptions and engaging museum visitors actively in viewing them and appreciating their importance for our understanding of the Roman world will also make a significant contribution to ongoing discussions of how museums should display such material (cf. SEBarc (2009) on Museographia epigraphica). \nThe incorporation of more Latin inscriptions into various spaces within the museum will widen accessibility to Latin epigraphy for the thousands who visit the museum each year. We intend to display roughly forty additional inscriptions within existing gallery spaces relating to the themes of Reading and Writing, Human Image, and Rome, as well as the Randolph Gallery illustrating the Arundel collection. Interactive activities will be designed to engage more of the visitors, especially children, in the inscriptions on display. Some of these activities will be high-tech, allowing visitors to view inscriptions via reflectance transformation imaging, whilst others will be low-tech thematic trails around the galleries for younger visitors. We also aim to realise the potential of EpiDoc for creating resources suitable for the visually impaired, something which no other project has yet put into practice. Extending the existing Online Collections website to include the museum's Latin inscriptions will allow visitors to the museum to find out more after their visit, as well as making the inscriptions available to anyone else who wishes to investigate the collection of Latin inscriptions without actually travelling to Oxford. Inscriptions offer a unique perspective into the ancient world, as both texts and objects with a voice. This impact would take immediate effect following the project's completion.\nThousands of schoolchildren visit the museum each year: the outputs will enrich their studies of the Roman world and extend their appreciation of another culture and society. Looking at Latin inscriptions will introduce them to an alien culture, focusing on themes such as slavery, non-nuclear family structures, and ancient religious practices. The gallery and online resources could also have a significant outreach impact, in introducing to the Latin language children who do not learn it at school. This will enable them to develop an appreciation of how language shapes a society: on a simple level, for example, they could consider why tombstones commonly evoked the spirits of the dead (di manes), and how that might differ from today's practices. For KS1 pupils, the project will fulfil the National Curriculum aim that 'They learn how the past is different from the present'. It will also facilitate engagement in Historical Enquiry of 'how to find out about the past from a range of sources of information' by showing them how material objects can offer insight into the Roman world. For KS2 pupils, the inscriptions could play a part in investigating the Romans in Britain. The collection of Latin inscriptions would also be of direct use to pupils studying for OCR GCSE Classical Civilisation and Ancient History, opting for the Roman Britain module (Unit A354 Option 6) and for A level Ancient History (A2 Unit CC7 (Entry Code F387): Roman Britain: life in the outpost of the Empire and AS Unit CC6 (Entry Code F386): City Life in Roman Italy). For example, some of these inscriptions illuminate the presence of the Roman army in Britain; others could be used to explore towns and villas in Roman Britain. The project will also facilitate pupils in exploring 'the definition of social identity through public buildings and inscriptions in public places'. This impact would take immediate effect following the project's completion.", "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects":

artefact analyses by bringing new transformative digital recording methods and computed analysis to fields that are traditionally labour intensive. The scale of the resultant technology and capability will generate a paradigm shift in the way that spatial and functional data are studied in the heritage sciences. Fragmented Heritage has developed a means for refitting knapped (flaked) stone tools. In this extension of that research, we aim to apply the method to reconstruct broken and fragmented heritage objects and monuments that have sustained damage as a result of human and natural agencies. This cutting edge research will provide museums and heritage sites the opportunity: 1) to record their important heritage materials in 3D; 2) to refit fragmented heritage objects digitally, which can then be displayed in 360 degrees; 3) to decide whether to repair the fragmented object physically using the digital model as a guide. This research allows us to contribute much more directly to public outreach in places where disasters such as war and earthquakes have impacted on the great heritage that exists or once existed.\n\nUntil now no one has been able to produce a methodology to refit broken three dimensional objects back together digitally. Our methodology is at the very forefront of heritage and engineering sciences. By demonstrating this research at the Jordan Museum, we expect the results will greatly impact on the heritage fields (e.g., archaeology, history, conservation), and for museums and organisations specialized in the presentation and distribution of heritage understanding.\nThis project extension serves to bring direct capacity and capability to the heritage infrastructure in Jordan and to afford the same to other ODA countries as a result of interactions during project dissemination.\n\nThe aim is to transform the existing virtual presence of The Jordan Museum. We will digitally reconstruct a sample of fragmented heritage objects to demonstrate the potential application of the 3D refit methodology for objects, statuary, and monuments damaged as a result of climate change, warfare, earthquakes and other harmful events. It builds on the existing Fragmented Heritage project by translating and applying research conducted as part of that program of research in the area of digital refitting and presentation.",

"grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Arts Languages and Cultures", "abstractText": "This project seeks to advance understanding about how experience of the historic environment creates forms of social value, including its contribution to people's sense of identity, memory, and belonging. Value is central to how aspects of the historic environment are designated, managed and conserved as heritage. For much of the twentieth century this was primarily linked to what have been seen as intrinsic historic, aesthetic and scientific values. More recently there has been increasing emphasis, in both public policy and conservation practice, on the social values derived from active use of the historic environment. There are considerable difficulties surrounding how these different kinds of value should be weighed up against one another. This is exacerbated by a lack of understanding about social value, which falls largely outside of the kinds of expert knowledge traditionally associated with the heritage sector. Furthermore, social value is not readily captured by quantitative methods or easily subjected to instrumental forms of cost-benefit analysis. \n\nThrough a critical review of existing research, this project will examine current knowledge and understanding of social value. Encompassing the significance of the historic environment to contemporary communities, social value relates to people's sense of identity, distinctiveness, belonging, and place, as well as forms of memory and spiritual association. Particular attention will be focused on the modes of experience, engagement and practice that inform people's relationships with the historic environment. The project will consider the thorny issue of how to deal with the dynamic, iterative, and embodied nature of these relationships and the value created through them. It will also explore increasing evidence that points of crisis and conflict, including those associated with difficult and traumatic forms of memory, are particularly potent contexts for the creation of value. The range of methodologies used in existing research and surveys will be critically discussed, along with their application in the spheres of heritage conservation and public policy. Finally, the appropriateness of a conceptual apparatus that tends to quantify and fix values will be examined. The possibilities for capturing more fluid processes of valuing the historic environment will be considered, along with the implications for other spheres of the Arts and the Cultural Sector.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "* The principle beneficiaries of this project are conservation practitioners and heritage managers. They currently face considerable difficulties in terms of defining and measuring social value in relation to a range of questions, contexts, agendas and resources. This critical synthesis, drawing on a wide range of academic and applied research, will advance understanding of the role of the historic environment providing a basis for effective and rigorous narratives about social value. It will highlight gaps in understanding and identify fresh directions. Existing methodologies will be evaluated with a view to their practical application in the heritage sector, as well as in academic research. The project will provide a means for the heritage sector to move forward and deal with this complex issue in a more systematic and effective manner.\n\n* Partner organisations will gain additional benefits through the opportunity to help shape the project in its early stages and to contribute to the critical review process in the context of the project workshop. The project will feed into their ongoing and future work, informing assessment of social value and its place in decision-making. The PI is already in discussion with three of the organizations about potential future projects that would build on this one.\n\n* Other professions in the sphere of Arts and Culture would also benefit from this critical review. The opportunity it offers to explore distinctions between what are seen as intrinsic and instrumental values will provide a point of critical departure and debate for other spheres. Issues relating to the preservation of social values, and how they can be weighed up against historical, aesthetic and scientific values, will be of benefit to those working in museums and archives. This project's critical exploration of the problems created by increasing pressure to identify fixed values and measure the instrumental impact of particular resources/events will be especially important in terms of identifying new directions and approaches which can accommodate the fluid and iterative nature of value in the Arts and the Cultural Sector.\n\n* Members of the public will benefit indirectly through the impact of the research on future conservation of the historic environment. In particular this critical review will highlight studies that provide insight into the unofficial and informal meanings and practices that mediate people's relationships with the historic environment. It will question the tendency to see social values as more transitory and/or superficial forms of value, in contrast to forms of value defined by expert judgement, such as historical and scientific value. Increasing evidence that the historic environment can provide a focus for productive memory-work dealing with displacement, conflict and trauma will also be considered. Overall, the project should provide a platform for a more sensitive and systematic treatment of social value from the point of view of contemporary communities.\n\n* For Academic Beneficiaries see dedicated section.", "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68", "text": "Sociology", "percentage": 0}, {"id": "12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247", "text": "Cultural & museum studies", "percentage": 0}]}, "researchTopics": {"researchTopic": [{"id": "AD75E543-5F70-43C2-A40D-4452373465C4", "text": "Heritage Management", "percentage": 0}, {"id": "ABBA5192-0B16-4BC8-8B3F-3A48625872F0", "text": "Cultural Studies", "percentage": 0}]}, "rcukProgrammes": {"rcukProgramme": []}, "start": null, "end": null, "participantValues": null}, {"links": {"link": [{"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/9B97D841-C49A-457A-B9D7-848848BD2AD5", "rel": "PI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/88C66B43-4D3B-44CA-9C04-6A107B2619E6", "rel": "COI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/152EA17D-97CE-4E16-BB35-467AC07A86ED", "rel": "LEAD_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/624E8F5C-EAD8-400A-9AC0-E02777400D80", "rel": "PP_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/A066D146-77E7-4A2F-89CD-D0507B15763F", "rel": "PP_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/3EAE04CA-9D62-4483-B9C4-F91AD9F4C5A9", "rel": "PP_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/funds/315C571B-65DE-4472-A32E-7BAE3EFC7A64", "rel": "FUND", "start": 1528066800000, "end": 1559516400000, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/keyfindings/55D683F5-83B6-40FE-BBC2-0B43B126F2A6", "rel": "KEY_FINDING", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/impactsummaries/EC893B40-356D-4006-8CD0-A8F2D384F338", "rel": "IMPACT_SUMMARY", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}]}, "ext": null, "id": "5A45E255-28BC-4E6D-A5B6-C0E6B1811F1B", "outcomeid": null, "href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/projects/5A45E255-28BC-4E6D-A5B6-C0E6B1811F1B", "created": 1582643293000, "updated": null, "identifiers": {"identifier": [{"value": "AH/R013500/1", "type": "RCUK"}]}, "title": "Victoria's Self-Fashioning: curating the royal image for dynasty, nation, and empire", "status": "Closed", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Kensington Palace", "abstractText": "Queen Victoria's name is used to identify an era. Over her long reign the British Empire covered a quarter of the globe. The birth of photography, and an explosion in print culture and the press, allowed her image to touch its furthest reaches. Her image, painted and sculpted, still dominates public spaces scattered throughout every continent. The narrative of Victoria's life has been rehearsed continuously since her death, testament to an enduring significance of her legacy. However, these narratives have not cast her as the focus of a culturally political study. Instead, orthodox approaches have set her up as a curiously inert figure, detached from public life and from the political shaping of the monarchy. \n\nThis project challenges these orthodoxies by examining Victoria herself as a pro-active political agent in the construction of an image for nineteenth century monarchy, and therefore directly implicated in what would become the Queen Victoria phenomenon. Bringing together an international group of scholars from the academy, research institutes, museums and collections, and heritage organisations, we propose three related workshops, and a conference. \n\nThe first workshop will discuss Victoria's creation of her own image, and the ways in which she managed her conflicted role, as a Queen Regnant, but also a wife and mother. Through a consideration of her surviving dress, together with the royal photographic collection, and Victoria's own amateur art works, it will assess how this image took physical form and was tested, honed, and developed by her, to serve the needs of the monarchy over the seventy-four years of her reign. \n \nThe second workshop will map the journey of this self-curated image from Victoria's private sphere to the public realm, and particularly across the British Empire. It will explore her involvement in the commissioning and purchase of painted, sculpted and photographic images to celebrate her family and its dynastic ambition. It will investigate their dissemination through print culture, and a burgeoning press, and their movement and use through many contexts, locally and globally. This will include the ways in which the image was used to counter critical responses to Queen and Empress, in attempts to quench the flames of colonial resentment at British rule in ceremonial events or to challenge republican sentiment from groups like the Chartists. This workshop will also explore how Victoria, as curator, presented the material of her life, for a public audience, in the first museum displays in her celebration, and how these were received. \n\nThe third workshop will discuss how the image of Victoria might be curated today in the digital sphere: how this material can be made available not only to scholars but to a wide, global public fascinated by Victoria. This will involve devising ways in which a project can be undertaken across a set of institutions around the globe, providing a methodological and practical template for further projects nationally and internationally. The workshop will consider ways in which the 'digital museum' can challenge the notion of the physical ownership of the material culture associated with this globally important figure, and can allow curation by a wider and more diverse audience. \n\nWe will inaugurate this project in late 2018, and bring it to a conclusion with the conference in 2019, the bicentenary of Queen Victoria's birth, which will bring it a special resonance. The conference will consider and test the project as a whole, synthesizing the workshop debates. The anniversary will also allow us to empower the pilot digital projects, which we will devise with the aim to touch a contemporary international audience in locations where her image still presides in sculpted form, or which are named after her, for instance, and use them to ask how Victoria's contested legacy is understood now.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "Victoria's Self-Fashioning has been designed to have impact in two related ways. First, we shall achieve impact through the content of our project; that is, the re-assessment of Victoria's image and the ways in which the queen curated her material legacy in the interests of monarchy and empire will change public and scholarly understanding of the queen and the legacy of the world she created. Second, we shall achieve impact by developing new digital curatorial methods for the interpretation and presentation of material culture, methods which can then be used for any project. \n\nParticular impact activities will include:\n\nVictoria's Bicentenary\nOur project is scheduled to coincide with the bicentenary of Victoria's birth in 2019, an appropriate moment for a critical reassessment of her image, her approach to queenship, and the material legacy she curated. We aim to overturn the familiar images of the queen as the obsessive widow ossified by mourning or the dour matriarch who withdrew her presence from political life, and reveal a queen committed to nation, monarchy and empire, and an active agent in their development. Because our project will directly involve scholars from museums and collections leading this commemoration, this reassessment will re-shape the presentation of and debate about Victoria and her legacy across these institutions. This impact will, of course, be substantial in the activities of the HRP and our project partner, the Royal Collection, but will extend to institutions such as the V&amp;A and Museum of London. Moreover, we explicitly address how to curate and present Victoria's image today in a post-colonial world, our impact will extend around the globe, first, in museums in India, New Zealand and Canada from which our participants will be coming, and more widely thereafter. \n\nPublic Events and Conference\nHRP, which includes Kensington Palace, Queen Victoria's birthplace, and the site of an early royal museum in her commemoration, has a network of many thousand members and patrons who can be drawn into the subject, through public events. The major event will be a two-day conference at the end of the project, which will enable our project's impact on the general public, as well as providing a springboard for further public and educational events at Kensington Palace. \n\nWebsites\nThe web will be a crucial aspect of our impact activity. Films made at the workshops will be available through the websites of HRP and the Paul Mellon Centre, and discussions are in train with other digital platforms, including that maintained by the Royal Collection Trust. Again, this will not only provide impact through the content of the film, but will also provide impact by offering a template for the animation of material culture online, which can be be used by other museums and galleries, local historical organisations, amenity societies and others.\n\nMuseum Practices\nWhile our project will have an immediate impact on museum displays crafted for the bicentenary commemoration, it will also have impact in the longer term, helping shape major research projects in collections holding Victoria's material legacy. These include a research project to log the first collection at the V+A, future displays and discussions planned in Germany, and elsewhere, as well as the cataloguing of Victoria's wardrobe at HRP.\n\nCultural Events\nBy involving broadcasters, theatre-makers, and other cultural practitioners in the project, we shall ensure that public cultural events such as radio and TV broadcasts, theatre productions, lectures and education events will be generated nationally and locally. Of particular importance will be the impact for post-colonial communities, not least in the UK. We shall ensure that publicity and marketing associated with events at HRP and elsewhere are directed towards these communities, in order to ensure a diverse marking of the bicentenary and thinking about the legacy of Victoria in the future.", "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247", "text": "Cultural & museum studies", "percentage": 0}, {"id": "972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69", "text": "Visual arts", "percentage": 0}]}, "researchTopics": {"researchTopic": [{"id": "E99BA5DD-0B5B-41DF-9B99-594DE94BA768", "text": "Art History", "percentage": 0}, {"id": "AD75E543-5F70-43C2-A40D-4452373465C4", "text": "Heritage Management", "percentage": 0}]}, "rcukProgrammes": {"rcukProgramme": []}, "start": null, "end": null, "participantValues": null}, {"links": {"link": [{"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/1FD4DDAD-A7BF-453E-98CF-DD0BD243D102", "rel": "PI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/ACD0CF34-1493-4FE5-ABFB-CDF2457FE42C", "rel": "COI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/8CE37885-348D-4616-8D52-E529659BE99A", "rel": "COI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/5AC90A7D-2AD6-4BF4-A68F-198A95959D85", "rel": "COI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/CEB496D0-8DC8-4905-8F65-D1ACDAD75C9B", "rel": "LEAD_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/43D19A7A-DE24-40F5-9C1B-FDB77BADEA77", "rel": "PP_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/funds/497C5CE8-DCB0-422E-A02E-1C912E59B5C6", "rel": "FUND", "start": 1548979200000, "end": 1643587200000, "otherAttributes": {}}]}, "ext": null, "id": "64A793A3-E3C6-4C87-B617-43ABE9D754F4", "outcomeid": null, "href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/projects/64A793A3-E3C6-4C87-B617-43ABE9D754F4", "created": 1582643293000, "updated": null, "identifiers": {"identifier": [{"value": "AH/S011595/1", "type": "RCUK"}]}, "title": "Rewriting the Prehistory of Jordan", "status": "Active", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Faculty of Humanities and Social Sci", "abstractText": "Jordanian prehistory begins with the traces left by human ancestors on a key route out of Africa into Europe and Asia. This earliest phase is mainly known from scatters of flint tools made, used, and abandoned. Around 20,000 years ago, archaeological preservation improves providing evidence for some of the most profound changes in human history. These include the development of food producing technologies, the domestication of plants and animals, and the social and ideological developments that enabled living together in increasingly large and sedentary communities: what have been identified as the earliest modern societies (e.g. Cauvin 2000). Similar developments took place independently in a number of regions across the globe (Barker 2006), but their earliest manifestation was in Southwest Asia. \n\nUntil recently, Jordan was considered as marginal to this process, but archaeological evidence now suggests that Jordan was important region to this transformation. Sites such as Kharaneh IV in the Epipalaeolithic show developments in subsistence and social complexity from c 20,000 years ago, while recent excavations at Shubayqa now provide evidence of permanent architecture from the Natufian period c 14,000 years ago. The earliest Neolithic, the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (12,000-10,300 years ago), was barely known in Jordan even a decade ago, but is now known from multiple sites. The Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (10,300 - 8,700 years ago), previously thought to derive from developments elsewhere, is now seen to incorporate local innovations when the Jordanian plateau became one of the most densely populated parts of the world. Although field evidence remains scarce, the Late Neolithic (8,300-6,500 years ago) continues a local historical trajectory when the farming package consolidates. Jordan plays an important role in the development of nomadic pastoralism following the domestication of sheep and goats.\n\nWith notable exceptions, such as Profs Zeidan Kafafi of Yarmouk University and Maysoon al-Nahar of the University of Jordan, early prehistoric archaeological research has been dominated by international researchers, and has been marginal to archaeology and cultural heritage presentation within Jordan. The narrative of early prehistory has been largely written by international scholars, whose focus has been to place Jordanian evidence into a wider regional and global context. With the exception of scholars working directly on Jordanian material, most Near Eastern Neolithic archaeologists continue to downplay the significance of Jordan, indeed, with rare exceptions (such as mention of the large Late Pre-Pottery Neolithic B sites), Jordan does not register in regional syntheses, and the crucial early developments evident in Jordan are often omitted. Prehistory does not figure in Jordanian school education, despite the many resonances with contemporary issues of settling down, the growth of sedentary communities, and the early development of an agricultural package that still lies at the core of Jordanian subsistence.\n\nThis project aims to develop a new generation of Jordanian scholars and cultural resource managers working in early prehistoric research. We will focus on Jordanian engagement, helping develop Jordanian skills, policies and procedures to research and manage prehistory, and to foster a new research environment with Jordanian perspectives and agendas.\n\nThe project will seek to engage the wider Jordanian public in prehistory, where a lack of local interest translates into a lack of protection for these sites. We will raise the profile of prehistory, show its relevance to modern life in the origins of herding, farming, and water management, all vital to modern Jordanian society. We want to show this is a human and local story, not just academic and global.\n\nWe will develop the tourism potential of prehistory, locally and internationally, to provide direct economic benefits to rural communities and the Jordanian economy.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "This project will have impact by (1) building academic capacity for Jordanian researchers; (2) building cultural resource management capacity in the Department of Antiquities; (3) creating a research centre; (4) building interest in prehistory within Jordan; (5) supporting the growth of tourism (local and international) in southern Jordan.\n\n(1) building academic capacity for Jordanian researchers\n\nThe training courses and associated seminars of the Rewriting the Prehistory of Jordan project are designed to equip a new generation of Jordanian scholars with the skills and academic background to conduct, lead, assess and collaborate in prehistoric archaeology. The project will conclude with a conference, where the participants will be required to contribute the results of their training (including additional work undertaken as Master's dissertations at Yarmouk University) and the output of seminar discussions on the prehistory of Jordan. Material deriving form this work will be synthesised into a heavily illustrated popular book on the prehistory of Jordan, in Arabic, targeted at the public.\n\n(2) building cultural resource management capacity in the Department of Antiquities\n\nThe DoA has specifically requested support to establish a new generation of staff who can both conduct research in prehistory when required by the needs of rescue archaeology in advance of development or natural threats, but who are also able to manage Jordan's significant early prehistoric heritage. The fieldwork and post-excavation protocols to be discussed by trainees during training module seminars will provide the basis for DoA protocols to ensure quality in research. The training will also help to develop DoA staff to be able to critically assess prehistoric projects, a vital part of the DoA's role in granting fieldwork permits and monitoring subsequent work and progress. A particular emphasis will be on discussing curation policies, in particular the needs of retaining material for research, and when and how it can be disposed of to help develop the long-term collections policies for the DoA\n\n(3) creating a research centre\n\nThe project will create a research centre for prehistoric archaeology. Projects depositing material in the Wadi Faynan museum will be asked to provide reference collections of material for use in the Centre to create a resource that will draw both Jordanian and international scholars. The centre will actively encourage international researchers to undertake material culture studies in Jordan, rather than shipping material overseas, and to employ Jordanian research assistants in their work. As a single centre for prehistoric research, the centre will have considerably greater sustainability than labs established to support individual projects or scholars within universities.\n\n(4) building interest in prehistory within Jordan\n\nThe project will promote the early prehistory of Jordan within both local communities and more widely through the Friends of Archaeology and Cultural Heritage. The project will hold open days throughout the project for both these key public stakeholder groups, and will also work with the museum to develop its displays. There are many areas of resonance between prehistory and modern Jordan, and an understanding of Jordanian prehistory will help serve to enrich cultural lives and the sense of Jordanian identity. \n\n(5) supporting the growth of tourism (local and international) in southern Jordan\n\nBy promoting the prehistory of Jordan, the project intends to develop both international and domestic tourism in Jordan, especially through the publication of an accessible booklet on Jordanian prehistory. This will be of direct economic benefit to the local communities around important prehistoric sites, from 'Ain Ghazal in north Jordan, to the sites on the Neolithic Heritage Trail from Beidha in the Petra world heritage site down to Wadi Faynan, in addition to benefitting the wider tourism industry", "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247", "text": "Cultural & museum studies", "percentage": 0}, {"id": "895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10", "text": "RCUK Programmes", "percentage": 0}, {"id": "6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF", "text": "Archaeology", "percentage": 0}]}, "researchTopics": {"researchTopic": [{"id": "14AE809A-4116-46B5-ABF7-DF8BCE2BF069", "text": "Prehistoric Archaeology", "percentage": 0}, {"id": "AD75E543-5F70-43C2-A40D-4452373465C4", "text": "Heritage Management", "percentage": 0}]}, "rcukProgrammes": {"rcukProgramme": [{"id": "C11BDEA9-7D9D-4728-B6A9-31032921B328", "text": "Newton", "percentage": 0}]}, "start": null, "end": null, "participantValues": null}]}
