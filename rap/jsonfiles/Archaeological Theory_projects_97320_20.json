            "abstractText": "Cultural Heritage will, in the near future, be subject to substantial transformation in response to changing climate. Mitigation and adaptation measures will affect economic governance, and introduce sustainability pressures on buildings and landscape (e.g. thermal efficiency, renewables), in addition to the direct physical, chemical and organic impacts from the changing environment (e.g. coastal erosion, landslides, urban development material dissolution, microbial colonisation). Affects will occur on a range of scales that will drive changes in conservation needs. We desperately need to understand the resilience of the Cultural Heritage against these transformational pressures, from a material perspective, but also how we can be more effective in decision making and management from government to citizen level. A complex interaction exists between social and material aspects; scientific understanding and innovation plays a central part in our perceptions and valuation of the Cultural Heritage. As a result, inorder to meet future challenges there is a need to develop effective, adaptable management and decision making policies and methodologies, that utilise to best effect the latest scientific and technological developments. We aim to form a cluster that will establish, in a regional context for Scotland and Northern Ireland, a unified and interdisciplinary response to these threats and opportunities for innovation.",

            "abstractText": "The Idea of Babylon is a study of the intricate and varied processes by which knowledge of the past is constructed, communicated and established in culture. The research brings the history of antiquarianism and archaeology together with cultural history, analysing the development of an archaeological approach within a broad cultural context for the representation of the ancient past that includes art, literature, music and theatre. \\n \\nThe research will examine how the ancient city of Babylon has been perceived and represented bring the in later, predominantly European, culture, together with the history of the site's fascination for travellers, its rediscovery, exploration and finally excavation. \\n \\nImportant areas include the views of Babylon contained in biblical sources; Greek histories; the accounts of medieval and later travellers; fine art, where the Tower of Babel and Belshazzar's Feast in particular have been major themes; literary representations; and antiquarian and archaeological writing themselves. These approaches to the ancient past are based on different epistemologies and produce very different kinds of information and meaning. This study is concerned with the interaction of these many sources, and the disjunctions between them, in the construction of knowledge.\\n \\nThe research will be of interest to specialists in Mesopotamian archaeology for its thorough treatment of these processes in relation to Babylon, but also has a much wider relevance to those with an interest in the history of ideas and the relationship between scientific research and cultural life. The completed book will make an original contribution to the study of the history of archaeological thought, exploring in detail the hybrids that are created when knowledge of the past derived from, e.g., biblical and classical sources combines with empirical research in the representation of the past. It will be argued that such revealing hybrids are neither aberrations nor the exception to the rule in the construction of knowledge about the past, but rather are frequently occurring and often influential in both popular and academic thought. \\n\\nThe book will also consider the recent history of the physical site of Babylon and its representation. This important aspect of the work will analyse the impact of serious damage to Iraq's cultural heritage on future archaeological research and in wider cultural terms. In this way the study will aim to allow the scale of Iraq's and the world's loss to be appreciated in broad context.",

            "abstractText": "Over the past 150 years, field archaeology in the Mediterranean has created a unique, rich and varied resource. Based on this resource, the research proposed involves primarily the widely published material record, the extensive collections in regional museums, and the landscapes in which relevant sites and monuments are embedded. This project will investigate in an interdisciplinary, comparative manner the interlinked issues of materiality, colonialism and identity throughout the ancient Mediterranean world. Explicit emphasis is placed on the materiality of both society and culture and it is recognised that human behaviour cannot be understood fully without taking into account the role of 'things' in shaping people's life worlds. In such ways we seek to breathe new life into current theoretical and methodological approaches in Mediterranean archaeology, especially into colonial and migration studies. The principal aim is to develop new cultural and historical understandings of how factors such as co-presence, connectivity and insularity impacted on the formation of identity and subjectivity.\\n\\nBecause aspects of these themes are already being examined by individual researchers in different disciplines and in various European countries, a series of workshops and seminars is proposed as the most appropriate and parsimonious way to bring together and promote research on the project themes. Thus the project comprises:\\n- a two-day workshop in Glasgow (2-3 June 2008);\\n- a session at the 14th Annual Meeting of the European Association of Archaeologists (Malta, 16-21 September 2008);\\n- a series of public lectures and informal seminars in Glasgow (autumn-winter, 2008-9).\\nThe informal workshop and international conference session will enable the project's core members to compare, develop and present their current research. The seminars and lectures provide a forum for informal discussion, and for public presentation of current work on the project's themes by invited, established academics from a range of disciplines and countries. These seminars and lectures will involve project members as well as staff and students from Glasgow University, while the lectures will be open to the wider public.\\n\\nAll project participants will explore how 'things' mediated the experience of Mediterranean peoples in the past, and how these relations were shaped and informed by long-term collective memories of movement, colonisation or localisation. The areas to be studied include different island and coastal regions throughout the Mediterranean, during several periods ranging from Bronze and Iron Age Crete, Cyprus and the Balearics, to the Tyrrhenian Sea and the Iberian Peninsula in Classical and Roman times. All aspects of the project are linked thematically and will investigate specific objects or material culture categories that played a critical role in facilitating contacts or creating distance between two or more social groups. Thus they offer insights into how Mediterranean identities formed, changed and endured.\\n\\nTogether, landscapes, seascapes and 'things-in-motion' provide the material basis and intellectual tools for understanding better how Mediterranean peoples literally constructed a new world. By confronting unexplored ideas and crossing traditional boundaries in a conceptually distinctive manner, all interrelated aspects of this project offer new insights into issues of materiality and identity in the ancient Mediterranean.\\n\\nThe project outcomes include academic publications (journal article, edited book) and a dedicated website intended (1) to disseminate the research of the project members and (2) to build a network of specialists within and beyond the UK (especially in the Mediterranean). A further application to the European Research Council is intended to extend the project into a long-term programme involving a number of postgraduate and postdoctoral researchers.",

            "abstractText": "The history of archaeology is a field of study which has been reluctant to engage with theory. In my work so far, I have tried to overcome this limitation and link developments in nineteenth and twentieth-century archaeology with contemporary debates on the relationship between archaeology and its political context (Diaz-Andreu 1993, Diaz-Andreu and Champion1996, Diaz-Andreu forthcoming a). In the last decade, scholars in the field of the sociology of science have highlighted the key role of contingent historical factors in the making of factual knowledge. It is argued that science is a cultural formation not only inserted in wider networks of social relations and political power, but, importantly, moulded by local environments -the geographical location- in which science is produced. So far this perspective has not been explored in archaeology. The issues with which I will deal are: whether it matters where archaeological knowledge is produced, whether archaeologists' location can influence the content of science and the national and international networks formed. Looking at the historical geography of science will reveal aspects affecting the development of archaeological knowledge not acknowledged in histories of our own discipline: mainly the connection between authority, places and institutions in which hypotheses are formulated. This research will be of interest to archaeologists, historians of science and, because of the popularity of the history of archaeology, to the general public.",

            "abstractText": "Archaeologists studying the later prehistoric societies of the Mediterranean basin have tended to emphasis the traditional nature of Neolithic agriculturalists, which are thought to have maintained an essentially egalitarian existence until the development of social stratification in the Bronze Age. The most traditional agriculturalists have been argued to have existed in the West Mediterranean, where opinion is also divided as to how and when social stratification emerged. For some scholars, long term inequalities did not emerge until the first millennium BC, while for others they were present in the form of early class/state societies in southern Spain in the third and second millennia BC.\n\nThe assumption those early agricultural societies where static and purely egalitarian is questioned by anthropological arguments that inequalities probably existed in all societies and that agricultural societies were neither equal nor unequal. Instead they went through cycles of more or less egalitarian social relations and had their own internal tensions, conflicts and cycles of social fission and fusion. This meant that there were continual tensions bel'-Neen sectional and communal interests and, as a result, different 'pathways' towards tong term inequalities and social stratification.\n\nThe archaeological record of southern Spain and Portugal has been revolutionised during the last two decades by the intensity of excavations and surface surveys. This provides us INith an opportunity to study the extent to which its early agricultural societies conformed to the expectations of these anthropological arguments. The aim of this research is to undertake a comparative study of different regions to search for evidence of the nature of these societies and their change through time. What is the evidence for the nature of social relations in different regions at different times? To what extent is the social change linear (i.e. towards greater complexity, or from egalitarian to hierarchical social relations) or cyclical (i.e. periods of social fission and fusions, or of greater or lesser inequality)? When did long term inequalities emerge? To what extent can these be attributed to the appearance of relations of class and a form of state society?\n\nThe benefits of this research can be seen on different levels. First it will bring a mass of new data on early agricultural societies in southern Spain and Portugal to a wide English speaking audience that does not have access to the local literature or cannot read it in its original languages. Secondly it will provide a case study of the critical study of change in early agricultural societies, which will be of value to scholars working in other regions of the Mediterranean and beyond. Thirdly it will highlight the extent to which social inequalities can be recognised in the material evidence of such societies as seen in the archaeological record. Fourthly it will open up a wide debate about the nature of early state societies and raise critical problems for the normal definition of such societies in the English speaking world. Lastly it will help the process of interaction and debate between Spanish and Portuguese archaeologists, and their counterparts studying early agricultural societies and social change in the English speaking world.",

            "abstractText": "European interest in ancient Egypt has been almost continuous since the Roman Empire, but has passed through various phases of renewed interest, notably in the Renaissance and following the Napoleonic expedition of 1798/99, which led to the development of Egyptology as an academic discipline. The literature on the history of Egyptology has concentrated on 'achievements', such as the decipherment of hieroglyphic, and the 'discovery' of sites and artefacts (with an emphasis on 'great' discoveries) or on 'Egyptomania'. More recent studies have focused on the presentation of Egyptian artefacts in museums and the 'creation' of a European view of Egypt, and on the development of Egyptology as an academic discipline framed within the discourse on colonialism and imperialism. Little has been written on the intellectual development of the subject or the dissemination of knowledge to a wider public. This study addresses the intellectual basis of the discipline around 1800, and its responses to direct contact with the country and its monuments; the interest in and impact of the decipherment of hieroglyphic, and the subsequent intellectual development of the academic discipline in (largely) Western Europe within the broader changes in understanding the ancient world at the time. It examines the influences of other emergent disciplines, theories, and methods of research in the nineteenth century.\n\nThe research also enquires into what the general public's perceptions of Egypt, and their interest in the country, were. The late 18th century perception of Egypt (exemplified in works such as Mozart's 'Magic Flute') was deeply influenced by the esoteric tradition and Freemasonry. The study asks to what extent did the opening of Egypt to visitors, the access to many Egyptian antiquities in the European museum collections, the decipherment of hieroglyphic, and the religious revivals of the 19th century affected views of, and interest in, Egypt? How did the newly available archaeological material, academic developments in other disciplines, and the religious background affect the way in which Egyptologists selected and interpreted the evidence available? Also, to what extent did the material newly available and understood alter the presentation of Egypt? The paintings of, for example, Edward Poynter and Lawrence Alma Tadema incorporated archaeological material that could be seen in the British Museum, and such paintings were later engraved as illustrations for Bibles. Similarly, Verdi's opera Aida was based upon a plot-line by the Egyptologist Auguste Mariette which was loosely derived from a newly discovered hieroglyphic inscription: it differs in many ways from Mozart's in its presentation of a vision of Egypt (even if neither work is truly about Egypt).\n\nThe research will consider reception theory as it has been used in classical studies, and how this can provide valuable approaches for Egyptology. The research does not ignore the imperial and colonial background to the development of Egyptology, which have been extensively examined, but attempts to expore the specific ideas and stimuli to the discipline's development.",

            "potentialImpact": "The research can be disseminated to the benefit of the academic community and the wider public through a range of means and organisations.\n\nSpecific elements of the research, notably that involving travellers, can add greater detail or new information to museum exhibits and records on the acquisition, provenance and context of individual artefacts. This applies, for example, to coffins in the Swansea, Edinburgh and Exeter collections: the link between these emerged in a piece of specific research that ultimately contributed to the formulation of this research project.\n\nOne possible use of the research relates to the William Bankes Egyptian Collection displayed at Kingston Lacy, Dorset. This is a very popular National Trust property, but the Egyptian collection is at present a rather underused resource. The collection includes an obelisk (in the grounds) that was of key importance in the decipherment of hieroglyphic. The rich collection of Bankes's written material and drawings could be used to explain the story of decipherment and development of British interest in Egypt. The links between Bankes, Henry Salt and Giovanni Belzoni could be emphasised along with the role of Salt and Belzoni in the aquisition of the Egyptian artefacts that form the basis of the British Museum's Egyptian collection.\n\nInformation on individual travellers, who came from a range of backgrounds - army and navy officers, diplomats, missionaries, architects, artists, politicians and the indpendently wealthy - can be disseminated through the ASTENE (Association for the Study of Travel in Egypt and the Near East) website, Bulletin, Study Days and Conferences. ASTENE has an international membership, with a wide range of interests, from archaeology to literature. These travellers and the development of Egyptology as an academic discipline are also subjects of interest to the local Egyptology and related societies in Britain: these number nearly forty, some with a membership of over 100 and hold regular lectures and study days.",

            "abstractText": "Introduction: HW is one of Britain's most important ancient monuments &amp; also the most prominent of the works which defined the frontiers of the Roman empire. Its international significance is secured by a long tradition of scholarly study &amp; its designation as a World Heritage Site. It plays a major cultural role in northern England today, signified by the use of the title 'Hadrian's Wall Country' for the central &amp; most impressive section of its physical remains. It also plays a vital role in the economy of this region (Management Plan 2009). Owing to the scholarly study of this monument since the C16, it has become the best understood frontier of the Roman world. \\n\\nThe major Output from this grant is a monograph which will explore the lifecycle of the Wall. This will include: c. 100,000 words, c. 70 illustrations &amp; a 600-reference bibliography. It will communicate approaches &amp; materials derived from the major research project, Tales of the Frontier. Arising from the historical research undertaken by the applicant (PI), it was not a specified Output from this previous grant (see case for support). \\n\\nResearch Context: Recent books have explored the Roman construction &amp; use of HW (e.g. Breeze 2006; Breeze &amp; Dobson 2000 &amp; Symonds &amp; Mason 2009). These stress HW's elemental 'Romanness', its relative completeness &amp; coherence as a Roman frontier work of world significance (Management Plan 2009). Its historical origin and context, constituent elements &amp; the exactitude of detailed knowledge are emphasized (e.g. Symonds &amp; Mason 2009). This significant body of knowledge, built up since the C16, serves to alienate HW from its post-Roman landscape and culture (Witcher et al in press). The fame of HW, recognized at least as early as the C14, has led it to play a particular cultural role, creating a rich body of artistic, mythological, antiquarian &amp; archaeological material; recent archaeological approaches, however, sideline alternative valuations. \\n\\nThis book explores HW's powerful &amp; contradictory significances through time, including ideas of permanence &amp; decay, domination &amp; resistance, exclusion &amp; commonality, stability &amp; mobility. It draws on a wide variety of sources to address the life &amp; after-life of HW, its ongoing destruction &amp; recreation from the C2 to the C21.\\n\\nMethodology: The research methodology, deriving from Tales, draws on histories, handbooks, maps, excavation reports, classical texts, inscriptions, novels, poems, letters, paintings &amp; photographs. A range of roles for the Wall are defined, in popular, mythical, artistic &amp; scholarly accounts. To place the rise of scholarly knowledge in a broader context, mythical knowledge, folklore, literary history &amp; art history are explored. Using a number of theoretical approaches deriving from archaeology, classics, literary studies, history &amp; geography, the Wall's life is narrated, drawing, in particular, on approaches to monument biography, reception studies &amp; chorography.\\n\\nA number of tales associated with HW are identified, including its roles as: \\n- a symbol of Roman imperial might;\\n- a symbol of early medieval Christian identity (Gildas &amp; Bede);\\n- a genealogical frontier in the medieval border conflicts between England &amp; Scotland;\\n- a conceptual boundary for the definition of lowland (English) 'civility';\\n- an indicator of ancestral valour for those living to its north;\\n- a major ancient monument which played a role in the formulation of antiquarian &amp; archaeological methodologies;\\n- a conceptual model for Britain's colonial frontiers in India &amp; Africa; and \\n- a contemporary inclusive monument for multi-cultural Britain.\\n\\nAudiences: Include archaeologists, classicists &amp; cultural geographers. The book also has significance for planners &amp; heritage managers. Posting drafts on the Tales project website will enable a range of audiences to read chapters in progress (see case for support).",

            "potentialImpact": "Students and the public: The author has also written a number of books which aim to be accessible to the public (e.g. Hingley and Unwin 2005) and it is expected that this monograph will be of interest to undergraduate students &amp; members of the public who have a detailed interest in HW. Indeed, much of the content of the book is fairly accessible. The Tales of the Frontier project communicated its aims &amp; results to a broad audience through the website, a regular e-newsletter, exhibition &amp; public lectures. This has created a public audience for its Outputs. Lectures given over the past 12 months include Hingley's talk to an audience of 150 at the British Archaeology conference in Cardiff in February 2009. He is currently involved in various initiatives including outreach through a contribution to 'Know your Hadrian's Wall', March 2010 (http://www.hadrians-wall.org/page.aspx/Know-Your-Hadrian's-Wall-Country). Consideration will also be given to the production of a popular volume to summarise the results in a more approachable manner after April 2011 (although this is not an Output of this application).\\n\\nIt is intended to make draft chapters of the book available on the Tales of the Frontier website as they are written. This will enable members of the public, undergraduates, taught postgraduates, research postgraduates &amp; academic colleagues to sample the draft texts. This will also generate awareness of the issues to be covered in the published book.\\n\\nPlanners: The research is relevant to government planners &amp; heritage managers who care for the HW World Heritage Site. The recent Hadrian's Wall Management Plan (Management Plan 2009, 26-8) contains the 'Frontier of the Roman Empire WHS: Hadrian's Wall Draft formal Statement of Significance'. This document, following the usual archaeological emphasis (e.g. Symonds &amp; Mason 2009), places a primary focus on the Roman nature of the Wall &amp; the survival of evidence for the scope, extent &amp; sophistication of the Roman frontier. It also explores a series of other associations held by HW; indeed, it specifies that the educational, recreational, social &amp; economic values of HW are far wider than its Roman associations (ibid, 30-2). The book which is the subject of this application emphasizes these alternative valuations, exploring the complex relationships between these forms of knowing &amp; the well-researched Roman associations of the monument. The Tales project was intended to help inform the wider appreciation of HW &amp; the perspectives outlined in the monograph will be of relevance to the deliberations over the future management of the World Heritage Site. The applicant's membership on the Hadrian's Wall Management Plan Committee (http://www.hadrians-wall.org/ResourceManager/Documents/Hadrian) and the English Heritage Research Advisory Panel, enables him to ensure that planner &amp; heritage managers are aware of this developing &amp; published research. Broader appreciations should have an increasing input into the valuation, management &amp; interpretation of the Wall over the next few years.\\n\\nAcademics: The monograph is primarily aimed at an academic audience, across a variety of disciplines (see above). The applicant will continue to network and lecture widely &amp; develop his academic contacts in classics, geography, English studies &amp; history in order to ensure that the work is widely read.\\n",

            "abstractText": "From footprints left by the earliest inhabitants of northern Europe (on Norfolk's north coast) to the buried prehistoric landscapes of the Fens (exemplified by Flag Fen), from the Neolithic flint mines of Grimes Graves to the Anglo-Saxon burial mounds of Sutton Hoo, East Anglia boasts some of the finest remains from the ancient past, of importance not only for understanding Britain, but also of global significance. And yet appreciation and presentation of these all-too-often hidden treasures remains at the local level, and is often bypassed by international visitors who may go to Stonehenge, Roman Bath or Viking York, but will mostly miss out on what the rest of the country has to offer in terms of heritage. This project will help establish a sustainable framework for presentation and research of East Anglia's heritage within a bigger international picture, including engaging communities in international cultural exchange through archaeology. It is envisaged this international positioning of East Anglian heritage can stand as a model for wider strategic thinking on presentation and management of British heritage.\n\nThis project grows out of two successful exhibitions on the theme of Japanese prehistoric figurines at the British Museum, and a comparative exhibition of Japanese and European figurines at the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts, University of East Anglia (2009-2010). These exhibitions attracted great public interest both in the UK and Japan. During the 2010 exhibition, an artefact from Grimes Graves was exhibited for the first time in the county where it was discovered in 1939. The extraordinary story of this Grimes Graves 'chalk goddess' inspired a series of further academic, youth and civic exchanges between Japan and the UK, demonstrating how powerful archaeology can be in revitalising local communities and for knowledge transfer and public engagement with new audiences internationally. This series of exchanges provides the inspiration and foundation for the current project.\n\nAt a time of increasing challenges to local and national heritage authorities (including council heritage services and bodies such as English Heritage), this project will help develop capacity within communities to realise further potentials of heritage resources within their locality by clearly demonstrating the 'international significance' of these resources, and the potential benefits in developing international interest. This requires a reassessment of the linkages between archaeology amenity groups (including local societies and Heritage Lottery Fund community projects) with those charged with protecting the archaeological resource, academics, other heritage stakeholders (e.g. tourist boards), and development organisations (Local Enterprise Partnerships). Central elements of the project's work providing exposure to the potentials of international approaches to heritage will be exhibitions and public workshops, and digital media.\n\nThe east of England has an exemplary record in researching, managing, conserving and developing the historic environment, including pioneering regional archaeological assessments, which informed future strategies for researching and managing what is recognised as a vulnerable and finite resource. In bringing a new 'international' dimension to approaches to heritage in the east of England this project aims to contribute to this exemplary evolving record. Using existing infrastructure (e.g. Festival of British Archaeology, Heritage Open Days), the project will foster new knowledge exchange between stakeholders, develop new means of interactive public engagement with archaeology, engaging new communities and audiences. It will provide access to examples of best practice in this area, hitherto limited to the anecdotal. The long-term aim of the project is to demonstrate how such an 'international' approach to East Anglia's heritage can inform policy and practice into the future, both in the UK and abroad.",

            "potentialImpact": "The 'Global Perspectives on British Archaeology' project will benefit the following groups in the following ways:\n\n~ local communities: the project will provide great potential for a wide range of enhanced interaction with heritage for a range of local communities. This will include free access to exhibitions and public workshops providing new international perspectives on our past and societies, and it is envisaged that the associated regional and international exchanges will provide great potential for opening new horizons for a wide variety of age groups. The recent example of the Thetford Teenage History Club's visit to Japan on the back of archaeological exchange is the most striking example of the potential impacts involved.\n\n~ Public and third sector heritage organisations: The 'Guidance Notes on Internationalising East Anglian Heritage' will be of benefit to museum and other heritage professionals looking to realise the international potential of future projects, including those involving volunteers (e.g. HLF). Benefits will take the form of examples of best practice in engaging new audiences through added value brought to such projects by an international perspective. The example of the 'Dogu: Spirits of Clay' project demonstrated how an economic multiplier can come into play (turning a &pound;375,000 investment by AHRC into an estimated economic impact of &pound;5 million). Such impact is of increasing importance given the challenging environment for public funding of the sector. Such organisations include: county archaeology groups; museums and galleries funded by local government and universities.\n\n~ Education sector: appreciation of the international significance of local archaeology and heritage contributes to motivating home students to engage with and understand their heritage in new ways, thus contributing not only to enhanced quality of life and creative output (as already demonstrated through the Thetford-Nagawa initiative), but also to the Widening Partication agenda encouraging more students to apply to study at university.\n\n~ International, national and local authorities: responsibility for archaeology usually lies within government agencies, and being able to draw on arguments for international significance would undoubtedly help justify public expenditure in this sector (and would be of interest to organisations such as English Heritage, Historic England, Association of Local Government Archaeology Officers, Museums Association etc). The research will also be of interest to international bodies (UNESCO, World Archaeological Congress, European Association of Archaeologists), and to heritage organisations in other countries, including of course Japan, to which presentations would be made (separately funded) and copies of publications provided.\n\n~ Commercial private sector: most archaeological work in the UK is undertaken by private contractors, often tasked with explaining the significance of their discoveries to the public and the research conducted in this project would aid such explanations. Recently successful organisations in this sector include the Norwich Heritage and Regeneration Trust (HEART), developed with the aim of realising the economic potential of heritage within a framework of sustainable development. The project would benefit from the expertise and experience accrued by HEART, and provide benefit to successor organisations.\n\n~ These benefits will begin to be realised immediately, and indeed the Sainsbury Institute's existing relationships have already informing the development of for example future HLF bids. It is anticipated longer-term benefits will accrue as the research results feed into broader strategy development across the sector.\n\n~ Research and professional skills: Staff on the project will develop enhanced public-interface skills; volunteers will receive instruction in database development and report writing; all involved will develop new international interaction skills.",

            "abstractText": "This project focuses on material culture in graves (and other formal mortuary contexts) in Neolithic, Bronze Age and Iron Age Britain, c. 4000 BC to AD 43. Many of prehistoric Britain's most impressive artefacts have come from graves - from the polished beaver incisors at Duggleby Howe, to Bush Barrow's rich collection of gold plaques and pins, imported bronze daggers, fossil stone macehead and carved bone shaft-decorations, to the coral-encrusted chariot-gear of Wetwang Village. For large parts of the Neolithic, Bronze and Iron Ages in Britain, a focus on burial is a necessity, as settlements can be difficult to identify archaeologically, ensuring that mortuary evidence is often the best and sometimes only information available. It is also the period when burials became a key arena through which communities negotiated socio-political change. An understanding of how the lives of people and objects were intertwined will help us to investigate the dynamic role of materials and technologies that shaped prehistoric life and death.\n\nAt present, British prehistorians have only an approximate idea of how grave goods changed through time: during the Neolithic burials were only rarely associated with material culture; the Early Bronze Age saw a dramatic rise in the quantity and significance of grave goods; the Iron Age witnessed the introduction of new and more varied classes of objects, but also significant blank spots where burial is invisible archaeologically. The Grave Goods project aims to shift our understanding of this broad-brush sequence from one that is impressionistic to one based on a solid, empirical understanding of the record. The project also seeks to evaluate and understand more fully the character and role of 'everyday' grave goods, in addition to the spectacular objects that so often capture archaeological attention. We will do this by constructing a database of all material culture found in formal mortuary contexts during the Neolithic, Bronze Age and Iron Age within six key case study regions across England, Scotland and Wales (see Case for Support for details). Once mapped and analysed using a GIS, this information will enable a new level of understanding of burial practice, and the ebbs and flows of material culture change, over that period. Building on the large-scale picture that the database provides, we will move on to investigate specific sub-regions, sites and graves as case studies. We will bring to this material a sophisticated new theoretical and methodological approach, pioneering a gold standard of funerary interpretation. The culmination of our research will be an authoritative and detailed book about objects and death in later prehistoric Britain, as well as academic papers and two conferences.\n\nThe Grave Goods database will be an invaluable, rich resource for others to use, in future academic research projects but also in the commercial heritage sector. Our research will have an impact on planning decisions, regional policy documents and museum practice. We will disseminate our findings to the wider public for years to come by using our research to inform a major re-design of the British later prehistory gallery displays at the British Museum (launched with a public conference) and talks in regional museums across Britain. We will also produce six schools' information packs on prehistoric burial. In addition, a mini-project will involve internationally renowned children's poet Michael Rosen who will produce three poems inspired by prehistoric burial and grave goods to capture the imagination of both adults and children. Via these outreach pathways, we also hope to begin to breach the British public's contemporary cultural silence on mortality, by reflecting on past humanity's ways of coping with death.\n\nUltimately, the Grave Goods project will revolutionise archaeological and public understandings of the role that material culture played in life and death in later prehistoric Britain.",

            "potentialImpact": "We expect a wide range of people to benefit from the project's findings: \n\n1. Visitors to the British Museum\nVisitors to the British Museum (BM) will benefit - for years to come - from a permanent re-design of the British later prehistory gallery displays. Given that the majority (approximately 50%) of the objects currently exhibited within the relevant galleries are grave goods, our project will be able to make a substantial and long-lasting contribution to the public interpretation of this internationally important collection. A public conference at the BM timed to coincide with the opening of the new displays, aimed at a popular audience and free to all, will ensure that those interested in prehistoric (and contemporary) death and burial can find out more in an academic yet accessible context. \n\n2. Museum professionals (and visitors elsewhere)\nOne of the main outcomes of the project will be a deeper understanding of the material culture associated with burial across Britain. In many cases, this will provide museum professionals with substantial new information, enabling them to contextualise more fully many of the artefacts within their collections, thus enhancing existing and future displays. In making our information packs available via local museums, we will provide museum professionals with an additional resource to use in outreach activities. In addition to the London-based events described above, the project team will give talks at museums across Britain within our six case study areas. These will be regionally focused in their subject matter, ensuring that the national significance of each region's archaeology is highlighted.\n\n3. Teachers and school children \nPrehistoric archaeology has recently become part of the National Curriculum in England (DfE 2014) and forms an important element of primary teaching in Scotland and Wales. The provision to schools of engaging information about the prehistoric past is currently extremely limited, and is thus be seen by heritage agencies as a 'critical priority' (English Heritage 2010); the issue is also currently under review by the Prehistoric Society. In creating six information packs, focusing on a prominent kind of burial in our case study regions, we will provide a valuable new resource for teachers. Each pack will include artistic visualisations of three key prehistoric burials, created by the archaeological artist Aaron Watson. A poetry project - inspired by prehistoric burial and grave goods - targeted at children will also be included, featuring three new poems by Michael Rosen, the internationally renowned children's poet. These will both bring the past to life and ensure wide relevance right across the school curriculum. \n\n4. National/local government agencies and the commercial sector\nIn providing a new accessible resource, delivering high quality evidence about mortuary traditions in six key regions across Britain, our research will benefit archaeologists working in government and the commercial sector. The synthesised information made available in our database will have potential to inform practice at a regional level, and to guide future policy documents and research strategies locally and nationally. We will design our database in collaboration with the HERs in our case study regions so that we are able to feed enhanced information directly back to them. Finds-related data are currently very variably recorded within HERs; this project will change this in one key area of especial interest.\n\n5. The general public interested in prehistoric Britain\nIn addition to the public events set out above, the project website will make our research widely available to all. It will be written in accessible language and targeted primarily at a non-academic audience, featuring an interactive Google Map which allows people to find out about burials anywhere in our case study areas. We will publicise the project's events and key findings in local and national media.",

A monograph entitled &quot;On the Margins of Southwest Asia: Cyprus in the 6th to 4th Millennia BC&quot; resulted from this study. The book sticks closely to the original aims of the project but more sophisticated models were used in the investigation of the data and in framing new approaches than had been stated in the original proposal. In addition to examining technological practice as a way of documenting cultural change, the book draws upon recent theories in ecological and evolutionary biology and adapts these to cultural change in general. The combination of artefact based research and a detailed climatic and environmental review has contributed to a much more sophisticated study of the period than was originally proposed. The principal conclusion reached in the book is that if all of the pressures that drove cultural change on the mainland were relaxed the result would be a stable hunter-gatherer economy with a bit of farming and herding: exactly what appears to be the case on Cyprus.\n\nThis study has successfully illustrated that as mainland Levantine populations were forced to intensify, Cypriot society was able to maintain a stable hunter-farmer economy for much longer. Although traditionally we have viewed this in negative terms as insularity and isolation, it is much more likely that conditions on Cyprus favoured the continuation of early Neolithic lifestyles. Indeed, results of the technological studies presented in the book indicate that Cyprus maintained low-level contact with the mainland throughout the entire Neolithic period.",

It integrates modern methods of biological analysis with the results of more traditional forms of Egyptian archaeology in order to understand better population affinity and changes in social identity both through time and space.\\nThe aim of this project is to consider the potential input into Egyptology that may be derived from the biological study of the skeleton. Egyptology has traditionally relied upon Egyptian art and mortuary practice in order to develop ideas as to life history and social structure. This project will employ techniques from biological anthropology to assess the reliability of these hypotheses.\\n\\nUntil relatively recently, within Egyptology, there has been some lack of engagement with both the theoretical and biological developments that are currently debated within archaeology as a wider discipline. The proposed research project aims to integrate scientific methodologies and archaeological theory into Egyptian archaeology within a series of closely related topics linked to ethnicity and identity. Recent developments within bioarchaeology have enabled the role of the individual within archaeology to be greater identified. In Egyptian contexts, these have included modern DNA studies of both modern and ancient human populations and assessment of diet through the use of stable isotopes. Moreover, many modern biological studies of Egyptian remains have rarely placed the results into the broader context of Egyptian research, and this material is thus not fully accessible to Egyptologists working outside of archaeological science. Detailed studies of single sites, such as Abydos, have linked the architecture, art and faunal material, but the human skeletons are frequently left as an appendix to the other archaeology.\\n\\nThis project, through the different chapters of the monograph, will link the biology of the Egyptian individual with their archaeology. The monograph can be viewed in a series of sections. The first involves concepts of affinity and group membership. The second explores Egyptian diet and its meaning to identity, as reconstructed from archaeological, skeletal, isotopic and funerary records and assesses where these records agree and disagree. The final portion considers the skeletal record for gender differences in body shape (dimorphism) and activity-related changes and its patterning within ancient Egyptians. All these portions are integrated to form a coherent argument as to changes in ancient Egyptian identity as evidenced through biology.\\nChapters will be as follows (with some aspects being considered summarised):\\n1. What is Identity? (how do we recognise identity and the individual?)\\n2. The Beautiful Death (death and burial as a unified process)\\n3. Age and Gender (children and childhood, the elderly, and changes in gender roles through life)\\n4. Ethnicity and Identity (migration and ethnic origins)\\n5. Stature and Body Shape (body proportions and Egyptian art)\\n6. Diet and Subsistence ('you are what you eat')\\n7. Activity and Robusticity (the effects upon the individual body of occupation and repeated activities)\\n8. Gender Reconsidered (differences between the sexes in biological responses to stresses within Egypt)\\n9. Regional and Temporal Patterning in Egyptian Identity (Nile Valley relative to the desert margins, Egypt relative to Nubia)\\n",

            "abstractText": "&quot;A long way from home - diaspora communities in Roman Britain&quot; (2007-2009: AH/E508758/1) was part of the AHRC programme on &quot;Diasporas, migration and Identities&quot; and explored the cultural and biological experience of immigrant communities in Roman Britain through an innovative combination of scientific archaeological techniques. The project revealed the considerable diversity of people living in Romano-British towns and resulted in national news coverage as well as a pioneering outreach project at the Yorkshire Museum. This follow-on project will enhance the value and impact of this research, and make these scientific findings available to a nationwide (and potentially international) audience of Key Stage 2/3 learners and teachers. This public engagement will be achieved through the creation of an interactive website and a teaching resource pact, in collaboration with the Runnymede Trust. \n\nUsing a range of scientific techniques, the AHRC-funded research project identified significant numbers of migrants in the burial record of Roman Britain, in particular at the important late Roman towns of York and Winchester. Osteological and forensic ancestry assessment was combined with oxygen &amp; strontium isotope analysis to assess geographic origins. Our results show that a significant number of individuals sampled (up to 33%) can be classed as non-local, with a smaller proportion coming from outside the UK. Contrary to popular perceptions, there are women and children amongst these migrants. \n\nResults were published in seven peer-reviewed journal papers and an edited volume. Our work was featured on the BBC 'The One Show' (3rd Nov 2009) and in The Times (26 February 2010) and we trialled outreach activities at the Yorkshire Museum (www.yorkshiremuseum.org.uk). \n\nHaving completed both the academic research and the initial outreach project, it has become apparent that the results of this work are of enormous significance to the way in which the Roman period is taught in British Schools. 'The Romans' are a central part of the primary school history curriculum in Key Stage 2 (ages 7 -11). Currently, the available teaching materials portray Roman Britain as homogenous, and any immigrants essentially as Italian, white and 'like us'. This kind of approach is exemplified by websites such as http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/primaryhistory/romans/ and children's books such as the 'Usborne Time Traveller: Rome and the Romans' (see visual evidence attached). Such depictions fail to take into account both the epigraphic evidence (inscriptions mentioning foreigners) which in many cases has been known for two hundred years and more recent scientific findings. Previous work by the Runnymede Trust strongly suggests that there is a strong demand for innovative educational materials about cultural diversity in the UK.\n\nThis project will address the gap between academic perceptions of mobility and migration in the Roman world and current primary (and secondary) school teaching by creating a website for children aged 7-14 and a teaching resource pack for teachers and community workers. To achieve this we will work with the Runnymede Trust, the UK's leading independent race equality think tank (http://www.runnymedetrust.org/), which has extensive previous experience of designing and promoting educational websites. This project will be of relevance to all primary schools in Britain as it will enable teachers, especially those working with children from diverse backgrounds, to portray images of the Roman world that are not only more relevant but reflect new academic research on the topic.",

            "potentialImpact": "This project will enhance the value and benefits of AHRC-funded research beyond academia through creative engagement with educational professionals, school children and the general public. The website and education resource pack will be of benefit to teachers engaged in delivering the Key Stage 2 (ages 7 -11) history curriculum but would also be relevant to those teaching citizenship at Key Stage 3 (ages 11 - 14). \n\nOther audiences that will gain access to these findings will be visitors to both the Yorkshire Museum and Winchester Museum (where postcards promoting the website and resource pack will be supplied to school children). We will also supply a link from our website to that of the highly successful children's author Caroline Lawrence who sold over 1 million books in the UK and whose website and blogs receives ca. 7000 visitors per year. Caroline speaks at ca. 40 schools a year reaching between 8,000 - 10,000 British school children each year.\n\nFinally, we intend to promote our findings and a link to the website in the magazine and on the website of the Young Archaeologist Club, an organisation promoting archaeology to young people up to 17 years of age (http://www.britarch.ac.uk/yac/). \n\nThe overall success will be measured in terms of numbers of unique visitors to our website and numbers of resource packs downloaded by schools and teachers. For the last three month of the project a part-time research assistant will evaluate current practice in a number of schools, and then conduct a focus-group survey on the impact of our new educational resource. This is not intended as a quantitative study but rather a qualitative assessment, and due to the timescale of this grant we will only interview a small number of teachers, focusing on York and Reading. York is chosen as one of the key case studies, and we will work with the education officer of the Yorkshire Museum to evaluate how teachers respond to the new information arising from the AHRC-funded research, which is now also incorporated into a new museum display. Reading Schools will provide convenient access for a researcher most likely drawn from either the Archaeology, Human Geography or Education department. If child safeguarding procedures and time allow, children may be interviewed before and after they have used the website. The researcher's findings will provide initial feedback to Runnymede and contribute to the final report to the AHRC; they will also contribute to a short article in the Magazine of the Young Archaeologist Club and the Institute of Field Archaeologists. \n \nIn terms of sustainability, the Runnymede Trust will maintain and update the website and cover the host costs of the server for at least 5 years (see costings). The website will be linked to the Real Histories website directory http://www.realhistories.org.uk/, a resource tool for teachers, parents, pupils and the wider community to support them in teaching and learning about cultural diversity in the UK.",

            "abstractText": "Pilgrimage is recognized as one of the fastest growing motivations for travel globally, with more than 600 million 'spiritual voyages' undertaken annually, with half of these occurring within Asia. 'Spiritual Voyages' include local and regional pilgrimages, but also large-scale gatherings, including the Kumbh Mela, which had an estimated 120 million devotees in 2019. While tourism among diaspora communities was encouraged through the 'Incredible India' Program (USAID 2010), diasporas occupy a complex ground between international and local tourism/pilgrimage. Indeed, in India, diasporas have yet to have their socioeconomic impact recorded or benchmarked. This is a particular challenge as diaspora communities are not recorded separately in current Indian government tourist metrics and statistics (Ministry of Tourism Report, Government of India 2018). Such assessments are critical as diaspora pilgrims/tourists are less likely to utilise the same businesses/hotels/restaurants/travel companies as international tourists (USAID 2010). They may also have distinct impacts on economies that are not yet being recognized in traditional measures. For example, it has been asserted that while diaspora may not spend as much money as foreign tourists, their expenditures are potentially more likely to go directly towards local producers and businesses, which may in turn have greater social and economic benefits for local resident communities (USAID 2010). Recording and benchmarking this impact is key as it has been identified that the benefits of large-scale infrastructure projects and initiatives to promote international pilgrimage and tourism within Asia have been restricted, and often do not reach as many resident communities associated with cultural heritage sites as originally envisaged (Coningham and Lewer 2019). \n\nTo bridge this conceptual and quantitative gap, an expert research network of academics and practitioners will develop a north-south-south partnership to identify the potential socio-economic impacts of diaspora tourism and pilgrimage for sustainable and inclusive development, as well as enhanced protection of cultural heritage. Whilst recent projects have begun to address how the collection of data on social and economic impacts of pilgrims and tourists at major pilgrimage sites can identify socio-economic benefits, the network and its shared toolkit will build on this legacy by developing a framework to scope and identify the potential impacts of diaspora communities at heritage sites. This will be based on relevant economic indicators, such as income, employment and business opportunities, and social indicators, such as education level, social cohesion, capacity strengthening, improvement of infrastructure and services. This will be achieved through the scoping of available quantitative data, such as questionnaires of diaspora visitors, local residents and local businesses including tour operators; visitor book data; site management records, as well as qualitative data, such as semi-structured interviews with site managers, community stakeholders. The network will thus scope gaps and develop a method for identifying and assessing this data, and providing a benchmark that can then be developed into long-term monitoring of the impacts of diaspora communities. Focusing on sites that are under the jurisdiction of the Archaeological Survey of India in Gujarat, Kerala and Uttar Pradesh, the team will undertake its initial scoping activities at major religious traditions of Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Judaism and Christianity, in addition to other religious groups and communities who utilize these sites.",

            "potentialImpact": "The development of an online toolkit to evaluate the potential social and economic impacts of diaspora heritage and pilgrimage will provide an archetype for dissemination among managers and lay and religious communities within India, where heritage is threatened by rapid urbanization and associated demands for agricultural intensification and raw resources. Heritage interventions and infrastructure developments are currently conceived, scoped and implemented independently; often resulting in unintended adverse impacts for sites, communities and visitors and pilgrims from the greater diaspora. Research by Durham's UNESCO Chair has demonstrated that the promotion of, and investment in, certain heritage sites can also run the risk of alienating such communities with few social or economic linkages. \n\nBuilding out from Durham's UNESCO Chair's participation in programs in India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal, this network will introduce the consideration of the social and economic impact of diaspora into immediate articulation with our established constituency of archaeologists, development anthropologists, planners, economists, accountants, environmental scientists, site and museum curators, site managers, residents, monks, nuns, tourist operators and specialists in conflict resolution drawn from international and national HEIs, NGOs, GOs, INGOs and IGOs. Confirmed participation in the Scoping Workshop stretches beyond academia to include representatives from UNESCO, the Government of India and ICOMOS.\n\nThe Dissemination Workshop will share pilot monitoring toolkits online with the broader Indian and SAARC community to illustrate ways in which heritage site can be preserved and developed yet ensure that stakeholders, pilgrims and residents benefit positively from impacts. To intensify this impact, participation from key heritage champions in Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh has been confirmed as well as NGO and GO representatives, including the Director-Generals of Archaeology in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh alongside representatives from UNESCO and ICOMOS, and the Director of the Sharma Centre for Heritage Education, India. The data will also serve to communicate to stakeholders and residents about the potential value and benefit of hosting heritage sites and thus reduce or decrease damage, whether intended or unintended. \n\nOur potential impact across this nexus was recognized in April 2016 by UNESCO's Director-General, who stated that &quot;There is no need to choose between the preservation of heritage and the needs of...pilgrims...This is the role of UNESCO and this International Scientific Committee, and we are determined to carry forward this important task...I know this works lies at the heart of UNESCO Chair at Durham&quot;",

            "abstractText": "Monuments and places are seen as containers of infused memory, but the extent to which they mold, enhance or weaken bonds of attachment and belonging have not been fully investigated. Nor has the potential of the material to act as the projector of memory into the future through an anticipation of a particular audience response and experience. It is these qualities of the bond between memory and the material world that this project seeks to explore.\\n\\nRecent dialogues between archaeologists and historians have enabled access to those pasts, which are not in the written record, and experiences, which are not conveyed through verbal or textual media alone, due to their subliminal nature. This has been possible through history's questioning of 'the event' and 'the fact' and through archaeology's exploration of how the material world can act as agent, guiding action and perception. To better understand such phenomena and the role of the participant or audience these disciplines have also turned to the dramatic arts. The tangibility of the physical world and how it is experienced is also a key research focus in geography leading to debates about the relational or culturally constructed essence of place. These strands of inquiry may not be surprising in what is perceived as a rapidly shrinking world, with high levels of human mobility. Negotiations about identity, homeland and attachment to place, are often at the root of investigations of contemporary migrations and politics in conflict regions. But it is rare that the impact of the physical world, and its role is brought into consideration. \\n\\nIt will begin by drawing on the insights from current research trends in the disciplines outlined above, and bring these together with the methods of practicing visual artists. The aim is to learn from the way in which the past and present multi-sensory experience is translated into their work, that in turn forms a lens through which to view and interact with the world. The power of an artist's work is in part drawn from the ability to tap into and embody meaningful memories, but also in the capacity to anticipate and guide a particular future response to their art. Hence the workshops will not only create a forum for verbal debate but foster exchange of ideas through an engagement with non-verbal sensory media. This part of the project will be enacted via an artist led journey into place, guiding participants in translating their experience through an artistic form. This, along with seminars, will comprise the initial meeting of contributors. The second workshop will reflect on and take forward the knowledge gained in the first through a mixture of papers and a presentation of the artist's work, in an exhibition, prepared specifically for the project. It is the intention that this will be a traveling exhibition, which will first be hosted in the gallery hall of Exeter University's Institute of Arabic and Islamic Studies.\\n\\nThe results of this dialogue will be presented in the form of a catalogue memory-guide, which will incorporate images of the artwork, a paper about the project and abstracts or views from the participants. These will also be disseminated, incorporating experimental art works by the participants, via a project based website. Contributions will also be drawn together in an edited volume, and a theoretical and methodological article on the impact of the material world on memory transmission. The wider community will be incorporated in the experience of the workshop through a presentation and public opening of the exhibition. It will also coincide with the 'Schools Conference', held at the University for local secondary institutions, as part of a Widening Participation initiative. As part of this event, alongside interactive seminars, the artists will use the exhibition and a short art journey as a starting point for exploration of key project themes of memory, identity and materialty, with the school children.",

            "abstractText": "Evidence from Britain and Ireland between 3500-2000 BC (the late Neolithic and Chalcolithic) makes this one of the most important periods in prehistory. During this time, we see spectacular Grooved Ware and Beaker pottery, metallurgy, carved mace heads, and use of some of Europe's most iconic sites such as Newgrange and Stonehenge. Recent ancient DNA data (suggesting almost complete population replacement at the end of the period) and dietary stable isotopes (indicating movement of people and animals over previously unsuspected distances) suggest that there is still much to learn. These new data challenge and reinvigorate older debates in terms of growing social hierarchies, ethnicity, religious organisation, and identity. However, these data have not been matched by developments in our chronologies; such fine-grained evidence requires equally sophisticated and specific chronologies in order to understand these changes. While previously prehistorians had to rely for their chronological structure on typologies of sites and things, we now have the ability to produce very precise, probabilistic, independent chronologies using Bayesian statistical analyses (e.g. Bronk Ramsey 2009; Bayliss 2009). \n\nBayesian analysis has provided precise chronologies for individual sites (e.g. Whittle 2018) or activity at types of site (e.g 'Neolithic burials'; Whitehouse et al. 2014), which were previously understood at the scale of several centuries. It allows a coherent way to compare scientific chronologies, and applications to earlier Neolithic sites (e.g. Whittle et al. 2011) have had international significance in the ways archaeologists approach scientific dating as a whole. While we have had excellent examples of scientific chronologies for individual late Neolithic and Chalcolithic sites or things (see below), no attempt has been made to write a synthetic history of the dramatic changes of late 4th and 3rd millennia Ireland and Britain using accurate and detailed chronology. Moreover, 'simply' increasing chronological precision on its own is not enough. To fully achieve the potential of the Bayesian 'revolution' (cf. Bayliss 2009; Bronk Ramsey 2009; Griffiths 2017), we need both an independent chronological framework, and an approach to 'prehistory' that moves beyond ever more precise chronologies for sites or sequences. We need narratives that can synthesise and interpret evidence from across 'packages' that archaeologists recognise as significant - such as the late Neolithic and Chalcolithic - and use precisely defined time-scales as the basis for discussing changes in practices, things and places produced by people in historically-specific times. Chapman (2018) has recently called this the 'central challenge' in order to write 'a new kind of archaeology', while Whittle (2018, 248) argues that the 'pre- must come out of prehistory'.\n\nThis project will do just that. We will build on previous approaches, producing site-specific chronological models for all evidence from Britain and Ireland from 3500-2000 BC, while generating a significant legacy of new data, in order to use time - expressed in centuries and decades - as the basis for our new narrative structure. We will make all data, analytical programs and outputs open access, meaning it will be possible to adapt and revise our chronologies in future research. This project's significance will therefore lie not just in our methods, or our routine chronological precision for 1500 years of Irish and British history, or our commitment to open access, but also in our new approaches to writing narratives of 'prehistory' in the future.",

            "potentialImpact": "As well as the academic beneficiaries, this project has identified impacts for four key audiences specifically in Ireland and Britain, as well as internationally more generally: historic environment policy makers; museums archaeologists; developer-led sector archaeologists; and members of the public.\n\nNational Historic Environment curators in the Department for Communities, Northern Ireland (Dr Vicky Ginn), in Historic Environment Scotland (Angela Gannon), in Historic England (Dr Jonathan Last) and in the Royal Commission for the Ancient and Historic Monuments in Wales (David Thomas) are project partners or collaborators, supplying data supporting sampling, and receiving outputs. The project will impact interpretation and management of the individual sites and landscapes, and research objectives, by revising accepted chronologies. The project is anticipated to have international policy impact in terms of curatorial advice, and the contents of planning advice set by national historic environment agencies, for example on Historic England technical guidance documents, or through a revision of targets for investigation and preservation.\n\nThere is a significant skills deficit in scientific dating in professional archaeological practice globally, and including in the UK and Ireland; this reflects the rapidity of recent developments and the frequent use of radiocarbon dating. This is the first large-scale project with complete openness in evaluation, analysis and interpretation. We will provide free training sessions over the project lifecycle, and free legacy resources, to aid practitioners in best practices for sample selection and analysis.\n\nProject-partner museums' collections presentation and management will be directly influenced by our research findings, revising understandings of the importance of different holdings, what material is displayed and how, and museums' future programs of analysis. The popular publications and free public lecture series (see below) will situate museums' holdings in the wider international context, and develop educational and outreach resources.\n\nCentral to this project is the relationship with the non-academic project partners, and the presentation of archaeology to members of the local community and the wider public more generally. A series of free local archaeological talks will occur at partner museums in Britain and Ireland. The lecture series will be filmed for broadcast on YouTube and the website. The series represents a significant added-value for the project as travel for sample collection, analysis and write up visits double up with delivery of the public lectures. \n\nAs well as the public lecture series, and knowledge exchange with museum partner organisations, the popular publications will provide tangible legacies. The popular publications will be produced by PDRA2 with printing and graphic design funded by the project; they will take the form of a series of collectable fold-out pamphlets, with one detailing the project background and aims, and seven additional regional pamphlets. These will be donated to partner museums to disseminate, or will be collectable from the website (see below). The team will work with non-academic partners in developing these resources, and the lecture series, to ensure they support other aspects of the partners museums' education work.\n\nThe pamphlets will be available from the WordPress site for download as educational resources. The site will include a team blog updating activity, and links to the project outputs. The WordPress site will be maintained for ten years after the end of the project (see budget). WordPress content will include links to peer-reviewed publications and project documents. Subject to ethics approval, the site will also collect metrics and feedback on the public engagement events, to evaluate and revise these events over the project lifecycle.",

            "abstractText": "Pilgrimage is the fastest growing motivation for travel with an estimated 600 million 'spiritual voyages' undertaken each year and Asia Development Bank (ADB) predicts that Buddhist pilgrimage to South Asia will reach an annual figure of 22 million by 2020 from four million. It has also estimated that pilgrim numbers visiting Lumbini in Nepal's western Terai, the birthplace of Buddha, will expand from 800,000 to five million by 2020. Aware of economic benefits offered by enhancing Buddhist pilgrimage circuits and the potential to alleviate acute poverty within the Terai, ADB has invested millions of dollars in a 'Tourism Infrastructure Development Project'. On account of the presence of Lumbini, ADB investment in the Terai has included all-weather roads between the light aircraft landing strip at Bhairahawa and Lumbini as well as 100 million dollars upgrading Bhairahawa to the status of an international airport with a 3000 metre long runway.\n\nWhilst highway investment has improved journey times for farmers taking produce to market, its presence close to the Indian border has attracted industrial investment in the form of 25 cement and noodle factories near Lumbini. In addition to polluting ground water, recent studies by IUCN have identified that monuments at the UNESCO World Heritage site of Lumbini have been damaged by airborne pollution. Speculative land acquisitions along roads and close to heritage sites have driven up land prices in some areas whilst proposed heritage buffer zones in others are inadvertently preventing sales. The latter has also prevented residents from raising of funds for emergencies and education through mortgages. In spite of this rapid development, many archaeological sites are still to be mapped and protected and a survey by UNESCO and Tokyo University has suggested that 97 of 136 known sites in Kapilbastu District have been damaged by the expansion of cultivation and settlement, both driven by accelerated development. \n\nUNESCO surveys have also identified that some of the Terai's communities have weak, if any, social or economic ties to the Buddhist pilgrimage sites where much of the investment is focused. This is particularly true of the sizable Muslim community, running the risk of alienation. Additionally, UNESCO surveys have found that the majority of international Buddhist pilgrims at Lumbini are day visitors, coming across the border to visit sites before returning to India. The also survey identified that their spend within Nepal is minimal as packed lunches, vehicles and even guides are not Nepali. Whilst individually noted, these disparate challenges and opportunities have not been collectively discussed and evaluated by residents, stakeholders and policy makers. \n\nIn view of this dynamic situation, UNESCO and the Governments of Japan and Nepal launched the 'Strengthening the Conservation and Management of Lumbini, the Birthplace of Lord Buddha Project' to protect, conserve and manage key archaeological sites before sites were irreversibly adversely affected. Focused on Lumbini in Phase I (2011-2014) and Tilauarakot (identified by many as the Buddha's childhood home) in Phase II (2014-2017), the team of Durham University archaeologists and planners from the project team now recognise the need to promote the development of an agreed multidisciplinary and collaborative approach for the protection and preservation of heritage sites and the evaluation of the positive and negative social and economic impacts of contemporary Buddhist pilgrimage at them. By expanding the partnerships between Durham's UNESCO Chair and the project team to interface with managers, residents, pilgrims and stakeholders, whether Buddhist or non-Buddhist, we seek to reduce the destruction and irreversible modification of heritage sites and identify and promote benefits, and reduce negative impacts of pilgrimage through the development and dissemination of pilot toolkits and methodologies.",

            "potentialImpact": "The development of site protection methodologies and pilot toolkits for the evaluation of the social and economic impacts of heritage will provide an archetype for dissemination amongst managers and lay and religious communities within SAARC, where heritage is threatened by rapid urbanisation and associated demands for agricultural intensification and raw resources. Heritage interventions and infrastructure developments are currently conceived, scoped and implemented independently; often resulting in unintended adverse impacts for sites and communities. Research by Durham's UNESCO Chair has demonstrated that the promotion of, and investment in, certain heritage sites can alienate communities with few social or economic linkages. Pilgrimage sites in SAARC have been targeted in a number of high profile cases, including the Bombing of the Temple of the Tooth in 1998, the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas in 2001 and the Bombing of Bodhgaya in 2013. In parallel but at a low profile, Buddhist heritage has been targeted by the art market as many marginalised communities are not engaged with protecting heritage and fail to recognise sustainable linkages with such sites and are keen to exchange heritage for immediate reward. \n\nBuilding on Durham's UNESCO Chair's participation in UNESCO's program in Rupandehi and Kapilbastu Districts, this network will have an immediate articulation with an established constituency of archaeologists, development anthropologists, planners, economists, accountants, environmental scientists, nature conservators, site managers, residents, monks, nuns, tourist operators and specialists in conflict resolution drawn from international and national HEIs, NGOs, GOs, INGOs and IGOs. Resultant data and recommendations will directly feed into UNESCO's International Scientific Committee for Lumbini, which meets annually with representatives from the Government of Nepal, local municipalities, UNESCO experts (one of which is the UNESCO Chair), ADB, NGOs, districts and religious communities to discuss broader articulation with Government, UNESCO and ADB programs. Confirmed participation in the Scoping Workshop includes representatives from UNESCO, the Government of Nepal, the Lumbini Development Trust, Lumbini Buddhist University, Tribhuvan University, WWF, WHO, ICOMOS and the Nepal Bauddha Association and the Dharmodaya Sabha. Participation by Tradecraft UK and development economists will also allow the recognition of the potential for future commercial links with neighbouring communities and households.\n\nUsing the western Terai as the archetype, the Dissemination Workshop will share site protection methodologies and pilot monitoring toolkits with the broader SAARC community to illustrate ways in which heritage site can be preserved and developed yet ensure that stakeholders, pilgrims and residents benefit positively from impacts. To intensify this impact, participation from the offices of the Directors-General of Archaeology in India, Myanmar, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh has been confirmed as well as NGO and GO representatives, including the Director-General of Sri Lanka's Central Cultural Fund, the King of Bhutan's Archaeological Advisor, the President of the Orient Cultural Heritage Sites Protection Alliance and the Director of the Sharma Centre for Heritage Education, India. The data will also serve to communicate to stakeholders and residents about the potential value and benefit of hosting heritage sites and thus reduce or decrease their targeted destruction, whether intended or unintended. \n\nOur potential impact was recognised in April 2016 by UNESCO's Director-General, who stated that &quot;There is no need to choose between the preservation of heritage and the needs of the Buddhist pilgrims...This is the role of UNESCO and this International Scientific Committee, and we are determined to carry forward this important task...I know this works lies at the heart of UNESCO Chair at Durham&quot;",

            "abstractText": "This project brings together several cutting edge archaeological research techniques to uncover the biological and social identities of individuals who were treated very differently in death, during the critical transition period preceding the formation of the world's earliest states. This unique opportunity has arisen through archaeological recovery of human remains from the site of Basur H&ouml;y&uuml;k located in the Upper Tigris Valley, a region that has been very important in understanding the large-scale interactions of the first urban polities in Mesopotamia. Sitting astride several important trade routes, the cemetery uncovered at the site provides an insight into the Early Bronze Age period (3100-2800 BC), which follows the withdrawal of Uruk (Southern Mesopotamian) influence from the much larger region but comes before the consolidation of the first urban states at places like Lagash. The changing political and social organisation of this period is not well understood and due to modern conditions, very little is known about the Upper Tigris region. However, recent excavations have revealed a cemetery containing elite burials, evidence of human sacrifice, and a mass death pit; three very different burial contexts which provide the perfect template to examine the changing social roles defined through burial practice. \n\nThe introduction of human sacrifice to the region has been argued to reflect the changing function of burial rituals and shifts in social organisation that are firmly linked to the rise of early states and kingship. This project will detail the differences (or similirities) in access to resources, general health, and kin relationships between the burials in the three very different types of grave to outline the social context of these new burial rituals. The project brings together the analysis of bioarchaeological information on the human remains such as childhood health and lifetime stature, disease burden, and cause of death with the analysis of thspatial and social context of each burial. Stable isotope analysis will compare ratios of Carbon, Nitrogen, Strontium, and Oxygen in different individuals and between tissues representing childhood and adulthood in the same individual to address issues of access to resources (e.g. meat) place of origin, and lifetime mobility. An ancient DNA assay will be used to investigate population relationships and test for the presence of pathogen DNA in the death pit. Brought together with a comprehensive 3d reconstruction of each burial, this will form the a uniquely complete picture of a society that has adopted radical burial practices.",

            "potentialImpact": "This Project will have considerable impact beyond academia. The CO-I (BH) has a demonstrable track record of considerable public engagement and outreach work that will amplify impacts beyond key regional and national heritage and scientific partners. These are outlined below:\n\n1. Policy Makers. The introduction of several new scientific techniques to archaeological research in the region is expected to both highlight the importance of the archaeology of southeastern Turkey within the Turkish Ministry of Culture and also to influence future policy decisions on appropriate research funding and project outcomes. \n\n2. International Organisations. In highlighting the importance of this project, it is expected that several international organizations active in heritage preservation and conservation will take a renewed interest in developing sustainable archaeological practices in the region. The international nature of the research will cement ties between prominent US and UK institutions, between the UK and Turkey through such organizations as the British Academy Overseas Institute in Ankara (BIAA), and provide a template for future collaborations.\n\n3. Commercial and Private Sector. As the main excavations are carried out in advance of construction, this project will allow commercial enterprise to see a demonstrable benefit from responsible corporate behaviour. Smaller local businesses in the region may also benefit form an increase in interest in the site. Currently, there are extensive plans to the Siirt Museum complex into an accessible multi-use site incorporating park space, public facilities such as sports equipment and picknicking areas, and commercial enterprises such as tea rooms and tourism-related shops.\n\n4. Professional and Practitioner Groups. The excavations are active training for new generations of archaeologists, and this project will provide an example of an integrated bioarchaeological practice. This will apply to UK archaeologists and UK students who are integrated into the project through teaching and training activities including through lectures at University College London, training schemes at the Natural History Museum, and practical bioarchaeological fieldwork opportunities in western Turkey at Ege University. Further training and teaching opportunities will apply at the Center for Advanced Isotope Studies in Athens, GA. This project will also provide training for Turkish archaeologists and students in biomolecular archaeology and bioarchaeology, including sampling protocols and research design. This will include a significant number of ethnic minority Turkish students and archaeologists who have strong attachments to the region under study but are traditionally underrepresented in archaeology and in higher education as a whole. \n\n5. Third sector. There is expected to be considerable benefit to third sector parties, particularly museums. The local museum (Batman Muzesi) will benefit from increased outreach components in terms of awareness and interest in collections currently held. The Siirt Museum planned for construction at the completion of the Ilisu Dam project will be dominated by material and activities related to the excavations at Basur H&ouml;y&uuml;k. Training in archaeological sampling methods, research design and additional support in outreach and educational material and activities will be provided to these local museums.",

            "abstractText": "This project examines how people experience and negotiate authenticity in respect to the historic environment, and why, for many, it is an important element in the production of a sense of identity and place. Authenticity is defined as the quality of being authentic, truthful, or genuine. In respect to the historic environment, it plays a fundamental role in determining what is worthy of conservation, as well as how sites and monuments should be preserved and presented. However, in practice authenticity is a nebulous concept and the process of distinguishing what is and what is not authentic is surrounded by complex criteria. For a long time it has been assumed that authenticity is an objective and measurable attribute inherent in the material fabric of artefacts and monuments. Scientific techniques and assessment criteria have been developed in an attempt to objectively determine the genuineness of artefacts and monuments, as well as the veracity and significance of their historical context. Yet such an approach to authenticity has been extensively criticised over the last three decades within a variety of academic disciplines (including archaeology, social anthropology, heritage studies, philosophy and history). 'Tests' for authenticity have been shown to be dominated by western ideals and epistemologies. Furthermore, many supposedly authentic cultural traditions and associated heritage sites have been shown to be invented, reinvented or renewed, often under the influence of ideologically motivated elites. \\nThis division between academic and heritage management approaches to authenticity leaves a problematic gap in our understanding. Neither approach addresses its powerful influence on how people relate to the historic environment, despite the recent emphasis on the contemporary social value of objects and monuments and the intangible aspects of heritage (e.g. in the widely cited Burra Charter and UNESCO's Nara Statement on Authenticity). As UNESCO's Nara conference highlighted, people's perceptions of authenticity are often associated with intangible qualities connected to aesthetic values, place of conservation and spiritual significance. Yet there has been very little sustained research providing a solid understanding of these aspects. My own recent research suggests that relationships between material objects and people, soil and land, often expressed through notions of 'birth' and 'nourishment', are fundamental to people's perceptions of what is authentic and what is not. Furthermore, whilst museums and heritage organisations play a role in attributing authenticity, this can be contested by visitors, who often associate it with intangible relationships of 'belonging' between people, objects, monuments and places. \\nThis project aims to investigate how people experience and negotiate authenticity in practice and how they deploy ideas about authenticity to make sense of their own place in a world characterised by displacement and fragmentation. Combining an analysis of the history of the concept with recent theories of materiality, personhood and place, I intend to develop a theoretical approach which focuses on the 'experiential' aspects of authenticity. Using this approach I will then explore how authenticity is experienced and negotiated in practice through a series of case studies drawn from Scotland and the Scottish diaspora. Qualitative methodologies, including participant observation and semi-structured interviewing, will be used to gain insights into how people experience and negotiate authenticity. The result will be three articles in peer-reviewed journals establishing a new agenda for academic research on authenticity in respect to the historic environment, whilst also highlighting the implications for heritage management policy and practice.\\n",
