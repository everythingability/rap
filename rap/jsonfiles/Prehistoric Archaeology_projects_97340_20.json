That is particularly true of artefacts from the Middle and Late Bronze Ages (c.1500-800 BC) which date from a period in which burial mounds and cemeteries play a decreasing role. Finds of bronze and gold have attracted attention from the late 19thC, but generally are studied from two perspectives. They were initially employed to build a chronology because it seemed likely that collections of distinctive artefacts had been buried together on the same occasions. By comparing the contents of these hoards it was possible to subdivide the Bronze Age into a series of phases and even into a more complex sequence of industrial traditions whose validity has been confirmed by radiocarbon dating (Needham et al. 1998). This was an important achievement but it also created a problem, for little of this material was associated with other kinds of evidence, such as settlements burials or land divisions. Rather, finds of metalwork seemed to occur in isolation. \\nFor a while that was explained by adopting a functional approach to these finds which regarded them as the stock in trade of itinerant smiths, who had accumulated raw material for later recycling or who had stored newly made items before they were distributed to the customer. It was even argued that these people had worked in remote areas because they provided an abundant supply of fuel. Scientific analysis substantiated the connection between many, but not all, of these collections and the working of metal, but this approach all too easily encouraged the view that prehistoric metalworking was an industry that was organised on modern Western lines (Needham 2001; Barber 2003). Moreover there was no clear explanation of why so much material had been deposited but never recovered. \\nNow it is possible to take another approach to the question. Larger numbers of Bronze Age settlements have been found and their distribution has widened, raising the possibility that metalwork hoards and single finds might have been attached to nearby settlements which had eluded discovery until recently. At the same time, it seems unlikely that many of these artefacts had been lost. Perhaps the hoards contained a specific selection of items that were intentionally committed to the ground as votive offerings, possibly by those engaged in working the metal. It seems likely that particular kinds of objects had to be deposited in particular kinds of places, weapons were normally committed to water and tools were placed in dry land. Work in Northern and Western Europe suggests that more subtle distinctions may also be discovered (Harding 2000, chapter 10; Fontijn 2003). \\nAnother reason for renewing the investigation of hoards and single finds is that new finds have recently come to light through discoveries by amateur archaeologists reported to the Portable Antiquities Scheme as well as the growth of developer-funded fieldwork (Barber 2003). It is now much easier to study the manner in which both bronze and gold artefacts had been placed in the ground because fewer of these collections are chance finds, and more have been investigated by archaeologists (Department of Culture Media and Sport 2005). This makes it especially important to study the wider contexts of these discoveries. It seems possible that the deposition and transformation of the raw material were attended by social conventions of which archaeologists had not always been aware. Not only is there the possibility of contextualising metalwork deposits within the ancient pattern of settlement, it may be feasible to interpret the production of metal artefacts in terms that owe less to recent experience and are more appropriate to prehistoric society. If the pilot study provides satisfactory results I envisage a further grant application.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": null, "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []},

"Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Archaeology", "abstractText": "Sedentism and Resource Management in the Neolithic of the Central Zagros\n\nOne of the most significant transformations in history took place after the last Ice Age, from c. 14,000 BC (all dates calibrated BC), when human communities began to settle down in villages and to exploit intensively the resources around them, including plants and animals. In time people changed from being mobile hunter-foragers to settled farmers and stock-keepers, with domesticated crops and animals. Often called the Neolithic transformation, this fundamental development in the human condition steadily spread across much of the world and led ultimately, through surplus accumulation and social differentiation, to the emergence of towns, cities, and empires, thus shaping the modern world.\n\nOne region where these developments occurred early is Southwest Asia (also called the Middle East or Near East). In recent decades there has been much work on Neolithic developments in this region through excavations in Turkey, northern plains of Iraq, Syria, Jordan, and Israel, which have demonstrated the great variability in local trajectories of development from hunter-forager to village-farmer. One area that has not been investigated since the 1970s is the Zagros Mountain region and hilly flanks of western Iran and eastern Iraq. Earlier work in this region was of key importance in exploring the Neolithic transformation, with excavations at sites such as Jarmo, Asiab, Sarab, Ali Kosh, and Ganj Dareh in the 1950s-70s. These researches indicated that Neolithic communities changed to sedentary lifestyles and began using fired ceramics, the earliest in Southwest Asia, by c. 7900 BC. Study of the plant and animal remains suggested that communities favoured use of lentils, peas, and nuts over cereals and that wild goat were intensively hunted. There was arguable evidence for domestication of goat by c. 7900 BC.\n\nSince 1979 there has been almost no fieldwork concerning the Neolithic of this area and the evidence is now decades out of date compared to the rest of Southwest Asia and beyond. The Central Zagros Archaeological Project (CZAP) is a UK-Iraqi-Iranian programme, focusing on the Neolithic period, run by the University of Reading, Bu Ali Sina University, Iran, and Sulaimaniyah Antiquities Directorate, Iraq. Supported by the British Academy, excavations were conducted in 2008 at two Early Neolithic sites, Sheikh-e Abad and Jani, with highly productive results. 14C dates indicate that the sites were occupied from c. 10,000 to 7500 BC. \n\nThe objectives are to investigate research questions within the Early Neolithic of the central Zagros. How did early sedentism take place and did it develop from temporary and seasonal to permanent and year-round? How was architecture constructed and how was early village space used and socialised? What was the role of ritual and human burial in social cohesion at this time? What modes of animal husbandry were employed, including intensive hunting, herding, and domestication of goats, native in the wild to the Zagros? What plant resources were exploited and how? What is the absolute chronology of development in the Zagros Neolithic? These questions will be addressed through excavation at the sites of Sheikh-e Abad, Jani, Bestansur and Shimshara.\n\nResults from this research will be of value in situating the central Zagros within the Neolithic transformation in Southwest Asia, and will serve as a model for the application of inter-disciplinary approaches to archaeological questions. The research will assist in placing our own species within a rich context of ecological and social change that characterised the Neolithic transformation following the end of the last Ice Age, one of the most impactful episodes in human history.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "Who will benefit from this research? 1. Those in government, and more widely, interested in improving UK-Iran relations 2. Museums and heritage bodies in Iran 3. Charities such as the British Institute for Persian Studies (BIPS), the Iran Heritage Foundation (IHF) 4. The wider public, in the UK, Iran, and globally, interested in an important episode in human history 5. Staff working on the project How will they benefit? The research will benefit wide sectors of society in the UK, Iran, and globally. At the broadest level, as a project of collaborative engagement with academics in Iran, the project stands as an example of how cultural and intellectual interaction can transcend the political barriers that are often imposed between our two countries. UK academics working in Iran are in the vanguard of diplomatic engagement, and can serve to improve the atmosphere of UK-Iran relations, thus to benefit the governments and peoples of both countries. Local and national museums in Iran will benefit from the input of new material and interpretations to enhance their exhibitions. Iran's developing heritage industry will benefit from the presentation of Sheikh-e Abad as a visitor attraction, close to the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Bisotun. Charities such as BIPS and IHF, as well as the British Academy, will benefit from involvement with a successful collaborative UK-Iran project, likely to enhance positive attitudes within the UK and Iran to such organisations and their work. All staff working on the project, from Iran and the UK, will benefit from involvement in a collaborative engagement, both in terms of enhancing their knowledge and experience and as regards the development of specific and generic skills which will be of benefit to them in future careers, within archaeology and beyond. The wider public will benefit from a significant increase in the publicly accessible knowledge-base concerning the origins of sedentism and animal-management, a major episode in human history. What will be done to ensure that they benefit? All potential beneficiaries will benefit from a programme of outreach in the UK and Iran directed by the PI and Co-I and administered by the Data Manager/Project Assistant, whose remit will include administration of outreach. Meetings of the Steering Committee will prioritise impact and outreach as a recurrent agenda item to ensure that opportunities are being maximised. Government officials and diplomats interested in UK-Iran relations will be engaged through invitation to public lectures, workshops, conferences, and exhibitions arising from the project, taking place in the UK and Iran. Museums in Iran and the UK will be kept informed of opportunities for engagement and displays relating to the project. As official government institutions, museums in Iran at local and national levels will be intimately involved in the project. Charities such as BIPS and IHF will be engaged and invited to support and participate in its public events. Staff working on the project will develop skills and expertise through training and guidance provided by the PI, Co-I, and more senior members of the project, partly in-field in Iran and partly through established programmes of skills development at UCL and University of Reading. The wider public will benefit from opportunities to attend lectures, workshops and exhibitions concerning the project, in the UK and Iran. A major exhibition will be mounted at the Institute of Archaeology UCL and University of Reading, with public opening ceremonies, to mark the conclusion of the project. The public will be able to engage with the project by means of the project website, components of which will be designed for the public, and through a programme of outreach via the media. Within Iran, the public will benefit directly from the creation of the site of Sheikh-e", "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []},

of sedentary farming communities", "status": "Closed", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Archaeology", "abstractText": "The transition to sedentary farming communities was a relatively recent development in the human past, first occurring at around 10,000 years ago in the Levant, and then independently elsewhere in the world, notably in China, Meso-America and Highland New Guinea. This was the fundamental change in human society, bringing to an end more than two million years of hunting and gathering by Homo and providing the basis for the first civilisations. The critical period of transition in the Levant is the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A culture lasting between 11,600 and 10,200 years ago. This period was originally identified by Kenyon's excavation at Jericho in the 1950s, and has since been explored by excavations in the West Bank region, notably at the site of Netiv Hagdud. Recent excavations at Jerf el Ahmar (Syria) and Gobekli Tepe (SE Turkey) provided striking evidence for elaborate symbolism and ideology within the PPNA, while those at Dhra', Zahrat adh Dhra' and WF16 in southern Jordan provided further evidence for economic, technological and architectural diversity. \\n\\nAlthough this work has firmly established the PPNA as the critical period of cultural transition, it remains little understood owing to the small scale of excavations, especially in the southern Levant, and the often poor preservation of PPNA deposits. Key questions concerning the extent to which wild plants were cultivated and animals managed, whether communities were mobile or sedentary and the geographic loci of key cultural developments remain unanswered. To address these questions area excavation is required at carefully selected sites so that sufficiently large assemblages of artefacts, faunal remains and botanical material can be acquired. Area excavation is also the only means by which the spatial and temporal variation within deposits can be fully understood. The project proposes to undertake such an excavation at the PPNA site of WF16.\\n\\nThis site was discovered by Mithen and Finlayson in 1996 and evaluated by survey, geophysical survey and trial excavation between 1997 and 2003, which will be fully published in a monograph in January 2007. This evaluation demonstrated that WF16 has deeply stratified deposits, good preservation of faunal and floral remains, a rich and diverse array of material culture, human burials, complex architecture and several large buried structures. As such, it has substantial potential to provide data to address a suite of research questions about the PPNA period. The evaluation also raised specific questions about the site itself that need to be answered by area excavation, such as the function of the large structures and whether the existing faunal assemblage is representative of the site as a whole. \\n\\nThe proposed project will have two phases. The first - for which funding is currently sought - will excavate a single trench of 600 sq m at the site, undertake its conservation and presentation, and publish the first of three volumes. The second will undertake the post-excavation, host a major conference and publish the second and third volume of results. \\n\\nThe first phase of the project will have five core staff: PI, Field Director, Project Manager, Data Manager, and Project Technician. For the excavation three supervisors, a surveyor and 8 professional archaeologists will be employed with 16 student archaeologists, and 12 local Bedouin workmen. Three excavation seasons, each of six weeks duration (spring 2008, 09, 10) will be followed by a season for site conservation (autumn 2010). An Integrated Archaeological Data-Base will be used to manage site records and faciliate development of the project website, archive and publications. Some post-excavation will be undertaken during phase 1 to enable a complete understanding of stratigraphy and site development before specialist analysis commences during Phase 2 of the project (2010-2014).", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": null, "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF", "text": "Archaeology", "percentage": 0}]}, "researchTopics": {"researchTopic": [{"id": "14AE809A-4116-46B5-ABF7-DF8BCE2BF069", "text": "Prehistoric Archaeology", "percentage": 0}]}, "rcukProgrammes": {"rcukProgramme": []}, "start": null, "end": null, "participantValues": null}, {"links": {"link": [{"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/69D756BB-561F-4B9F-B9E2-71F0CAE457BD", "rel": "PI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/961756BF-E31F-4A13-836F-0A09BA02385C", "rel": "LEAD_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/B89C3D3E-5BF7-4B67-99F6-58DC40ABB2C0", "rel": "COLLAB_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/EA5F3181-FAD9-4DD1-A81D-6EFB23BF9805", "rel": "COLLAB_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/funds/0BD67633-B8DD-45CF-BA59-CE86D0BF7F55", "rel": "FUND", "start": 1317423600000, "end": 1369954800000, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/keyfindings/0B11B7E9-8D81-4AAA-B3C8-154513999034", "rel": "KEY_FINDING", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/collaborations/507A113D-A698-400E-8310-B1F7D0746742", "rel": "COLLABORATION", "start": 1325376000000, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/collaborations/00478ECF-99DC-4B50-928F-814B0D5D302F", "rel": "COLLABORATION", "start": 1325376000000, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/furtherfundings/EF9F3AC2-CA98-4C55-93F4-2A7C290ADCD1", "rel": "FURTHER_FUNDING", "start": 1496271600000, "end": 1593644400000, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/furtherfundings/113D899F-F39B-427C-971F-4D343C2CCB87", "rel": "FURTHER_FUNDING", "start": 1351728000000, "end": 1478044800000, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/furtherfundings/E8F7DC1E-6C50-4925-804A-2B9AEA25FE9E", "rel": "FURTHER_FUNDING", "start": 1417392000000, "end": 1480636800000, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/furtherfundings/BD61ACCB-2F07-4A59-9FB7-B8EE567E7014", "rel": "FURTHER_FUNDING", "start": 1506812400000, "end": 1527894000000, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/impactsummaries/47F08E2C-6242-417C-8628-8421E1EE2D1A", "rel": "IMPACT_SUMMARY", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/87913067-9CA5-4D83-A7AC-87454A19463D", "rel": "PUBLICATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/63EBFBCA-3214-4A28-9BE9-209BBDC5AECD", "rel": "PUBLICATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/DDD704A9-C1B9-45DB-8F48-6E807F98358E", "rel": "PUBLICATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/7FF9C6D3-F7CA-4B03-87FD-DE5884C98B01", "rel": "PUBLICATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/8B8086FF-4654-41D3-85C4-2C1C04E42DB7", "rel": "PUBLICATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}]}, "ext": null, "id": "DC379255-6194-4C68-8F09-8885E692777F", "outcomeid": null, "href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/projects/DC379255-6194-4C68-8F09-8885E692777F", "created": 1582643293000, "updated": null, "identifiers": {"identifier": [{"value": "AH/I025417/1", "type": "RCUK"}]}, "title": "A social landscape without a center: the circulation of materials and skills in NW Argentina during the first millennium AD", "status": "Closed", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Archaeology", "abstractText": "The south-central Andes have provided one of the richest and oldest records of long-distance social interaction in the Americas. In NW Argentina in particular, the Formative period (1500 BC-600 AD) sees the blossoming of sedentary communities that connected across the landscape to access a variety of resources, while expanding their social world beyond daily face-to-face interaction. The project will develop our understanding of the role of the circulation of artefacts in the construction and reproduction of social life among early sedentary communities, at a time when new categories of artefacts emerged and became part of more frequent long-distance relationships. The project seeks to answer the question of how diversified social networks were in the period, by carefully examining rather than assuming the nature, scale, direction, frequency and significance of such contacts. \\n\\nThis project will expand the initial results of previous research conducted by the PI on provenance and technology analysis of lithic artefacts and pottery from the southern Calchaqu&iacute; valleys of north western Argentina (NWA). This previous pilot study, funded by a British Academy Small Research Grant, proved the sensitivity of the methodology to identify the multiple and possibly competing links that were active between communities at the time, which were sustained through transactions and decisions around the use and manufacture of everyday crafts. The potential revealed by this preliminary project calls for substantive work to be completed through a larger sampling program. While the previous study has provided a useful baseline for a confident discussion of some of the key assumptions that underlie the study of social interaction in the region, it is still far from the sampling sizes that have resulted in robust comparable studies worldwide. Funds are requested for a period of 12 months to carry on with the sampling, processing and publication of the results. \\n\\nThe project will analyz archaeological materials from the valleys of Santa Mar&iacute;a, Caj&oacute;n, El Bols&oacute;n, Hualf&iacute;n, and the western slope of the Aconquija Mountains. The human settlement of the area in sparse villages unfolded throughout the first millennium AD, which encompasses the Formative period and the transition to the Late Period when larger polities emerged. Ongoing studies by the PI and collaborators have uncovered little evidence of internal differentiation, yet despite their non-elite characteristics the sites were well-embedded in regional networks involving a wide array of materials and crafts. This contradicts standard models of the period, which have argued for centralized elite control of social networks. Combining geochemical provenance analysis of pottery and lithics, petrography, stone tool analysis and regional mapping, the project will build upon existing research to develop a solid database that will allow the building of an alternative model of social interaction in the period. Except for the previous pilot study, there are no antecedents in the region of comparable research combining materials traditionally studied separately.

Advancement of knowledge about ancient social networks in the south-central Andes through the integration of archeological, geochemical and spatial analytical methods. Through the submission of an article to the highly-ranked journal American Anthropologist, the research will impact upon the wider academic community by providing an important empirical, methodological, and theoretical counterpoint to existing comparable research worldwide. \\n\\n2. Feeding into existing local academic forums through specific public events, such as an invited talk open to academics, heritage professionals and community stake holders, and the presentation of the project at a prestigious regional academic forum that will establish the baseline for the first major concerted academic effort in archaeological public outreach in Argentina. This will effectively demonstrate the University of Exeter's leading role among UK institutions in the production of empirically sound studies that can improve the understanding of long-term human practices worldwide.\\n \\n3. Strengthening international relationships between academics in the UK, Argentina and USA. The University of Exeter will act as a nexus for international collaboration in the social study of the material culture of social interaction, thus placing UK-based researchers at the vanguard in this crucial area of research at the intersection of the humanities and the sciences. This will be facilitated by the University of Exeter's Centre for the Archaeology of the Americas.\\n\\n4. Cultural and social benefits will develop following the enhanced knowledge of the local indigenous past, particularly via the demonstration of its diversity and creativity through empirical research. Community-oriented posters and a regularly updated webpage will report on the project aims and activities. The PI will offer to introduce the project to local indigenous stakeholders.\\n\\n5.

It has been there since the 11th century AD. There is no evidence any boundary existed in prehistory, yet archaeologists interested in prehistory have often worked on one side or other of this border. But what if we approached the landscape and the archaeological remains from around the River Tyne to around the River Forth as undivided by the border? Then we could consider the wider patterns made by prehistoric communities in establishing and maintaining their social networks across this landscape. To do this we need to create a new social network, bringing archaeologists and other specialists from England and Scotland together in the Tyne-Forth Prehistory Forum. \\n\\nWe have already explored in two 'trials' that we can bring together these archaeologists, specialists interested in the materials people used, scientists interested in understanding how people once lived and farmed, colleagues who conserve and protect archaeological sites and landscapes, and those vital sparks, the amateur enthusiasts. We know the idea works: we reviewed the state of the existing 'regional research frameworks' at the first Tyne-Forth Prehistory Forum; at the second we began to discuss prehistoric communities living in the upland environments of the Cheviot Hills. \\n\\nThere is great enthusiasm among members of this forum to accelerate this interaction and to investigate together how further research can be conducted to investigate these past communities and their environments. We are applying for financial support for the Tyne-Forth Forum. In particular we are asking to cover the cost of attending our meetings for young researchers struggling on grants, experts retired from work, amateur enthusiasts with no sources of money and archaeological contractors who nowadays find few chances to grapple with research questions. We will prehistoric evidence in the landscape through a field visit and hold meetings in various venues around the region. The programme of meetings we propose will knit the diverse research groups together as a community which can continue collaboration for years to come. We aim to be a forum for debate in which methods of working and terminologies can be compared, where what is special and important about our region can be discussed, and similarities with neighbouring regions can be compared. We intend to create a space where we can discuss gaps in existing knowledge and how we might develop strategies to learn more, where we can bring together the work of many specialists who otherwise seldom meet to discuss these themes and where expertise can be shared and developed. We will do this through five themed conference meetings held at different venues around the region, a field trip to key sites and landscapes, and through e-newsletters, a web-page and magazine pieces. We will advertise our events widely and encourage new members to join the 65 or so already committed. There are many cutting-edge topics to explore, from how people inhabited their changing landscapes, to the social and trade links that supported past communities, to cultural similarities and differences (in, for instance, how they treated their dead), to how these societies were organised and structured. We will encourage new, collaborative research by helping individuals meet to plan and discuss such ventures. Our links and collaborations will be much stronger and more enduring by the time this financial support for our project ceases, and we anticipate that research projects springing from this Forum will lead to further conferences and discussions in the future.

The voluntary sector, those myriad small local societies and groups, will gain from knowing that their contribution is securely embedded in an internationally significant research context. Commercial developers concerned with planning work in the region might benefit from an approach to archaeological protection and conservation that was more seamless across the region. We have established important connections with the major museums and heritage bodies in the region, and through these and by the provision of material to other organisations we can increase local and touristic awareness of this well-preserved and beautifully evocative cultural landscape. The newly-opened Great North Museum was pleased to host our second meeting, several prehistorians in the National Museums of Scotland in Edinburgh have attended both meetings, Northumberland National Park and the North Pennines Area of Natural Beauty have representatives in the Forum, and both place great store in cultural heritage in appealing to tourists and raising revenue. Further volunteer groups and smaller museums will be encouraged to belong to the Forum, and in this landscape the potential for heritage trails is great, as at Lordenshaws in the Northumberland National Park and the Maelmin Heritage Trail at Milfield, designed by Clive Waddington of Archaeological Research Services, a Forum member. Indeed, the close link betwen society and environment is a key research topic in the region for all time periods, and as we learn that the natural heritage is really a cultural one, the links with nature and landscape conservation should become more explicit. Work in this area by David Passmore (Newcastle University) was presented at our second meeting. Making and explaining connections between people's social, cultural and economic activities in prehistory and the sometimes extraordinarily dramatic environmental changes they wrought is a highly significant way to explore ideas of fragility and restoration.

Most scientists agree that humans speciated in Africa some 200-150 kya (thousand years ago). However, considerable debate surrounds the timing and nature of our ancestors' subsequent dispersal from the African continent, with genetic evidence suggesting a date of ~80-50 kya, and archaeological evidence from Arabia and India suggesting earlier estimates back to perhaps 100 kya. Recent research demonstrates that South Asia is a critical region for understanding the Homo sapiens dispersal, as it was one of the first areas outside Africa to be occupied, and saw dramatic early population expansion. The 'Southern Dispersal' hypothesis posits that the route of movement out of Africa was along southern coastlines through South Asia and then onwards to Australia, accounting for occupation in the latter pre-dating that of Europe. However, the colonisation of South Asia has seen relatively little research when compared to other regions.\\n\\nThis study examines the archaeological record of key sites in northern India. The research looks in detail at the way our ancestors manufactured the stone artefacts that they used to hunt, collect plant foods and manufacture other tools. By examining the process of tool manufacture we can draw links between human groups in different parts of the world and attempt to track the spread of humans even in the absence of skeletal evidence. Importantly, by comparing the tools made by our direct Homo sapiens ancestors to those of the archaic human species that they replaced in India, we can look at differences and similarities in their behaviour and adaptations to South Asian conditions. Many people are aware of debates over the replacement of Neanderthals by modern humans in Europe, but few are aware that the same process occurred in other parts of the world, including South Asia. This study aims to gather data on stone technology that will allow us to better reconstruct the process of replacement in the Indian subcontinent, providing greater insight into the geographical variation involved in human dispersal than is currently available.\\n", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "The impacts of the proposed research are spread across a number of levels, including personal, institutional, intellectual and public interest. Consideration of the trajectory of human evolution and our place in the natural world has been of fundamental concern to most members of society throughout human history, and the rapid expansion of archaeological science and mass communication of archaeological findings in the last half century have only accelerated that interest. This situation is enhanced by research, such as the current proposal, that aims to begin filling significant gaps in our knowledge, producing a more satisfactory understanding of how we came to be the dominant species on the planet. At the broadest level, therefore, this project will improve quality of life for people in both South Asia and elsewhere by helping resolve otherwise intractable issues in the history of humanity. Recognition of this public interest brings media attention (recent Late Pleistocene excavations I have directed in India have been filmed by the BBC and National Geographic, for example), which brings global recognition that UK and Indian scientists are at the forefront of human dispersal research and promotes continued UK academic competitiveness. Media attention on the topic of human evolution also helps establish a more general recognition of evolution's central role in shaping our world, which is important for countering pseudo-scientific origins stories based on religious agenda. On the ground in India, one of the primary impacts is increased recognition of and respect for the importance of archaeological sites and materials, with attendant economic benefits derived from cultural tourism. The Indian academic institutions and museums included in the project will benefit from attention directed towards their excavated collections, and it is hoped that this attention will further assist in raising standards for collections management in India.\\n\\nOn an intellectual level, the results of this research and the framework for further investigation which it aims to develop will be of considerable impact for researchers in fields such as archaeology, palaeoanthropology, evolutionary ecology, palaeoclimate, cognitive science, population genetics and social anthropology, as we consider the biological and social implications of the replacement of a previous hominin species by our own in India. Focusing the attention of such a diverse group of scientists on one central question brings added benefit, through development of inter-disciplinary ties and cross-pollination of research techniques and theoretical approaches. This outcome dovetails with identified research priorities: in a recent opinion piece in the journal Nature (7 January 2010, p.28), President of the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research Leslie Aiello identified an increased focus on Asia's place in the human evolutionary story as one of the most important research challenges for the next decade. For the proposed project, the central methods of reaching these academic audiences are refereed archaeological journal articles and presentation at international meetings.\\n\\nOn the level of personal development, the proposed study is a new extension of my current research into the effects of the Toba volcanic super-eruption 74,000 years ago on hominins in India. Applying the same technological approach to the question of the last pre-sapiens hominins in India and the humans who replaced them will permit further career development in this area, with flow-on impacts to students whom I am advising at Oxford University and in India.

The site occupies a unique position in Minoan archaeology as it is the most fully excavated Bronze Age town on the island; it is also the largest that exists without a palace or any other kind of central building. While future research may yet reveal such a structure, at present the numerous town buildings in themselves provide considerable evidence for the economic, social and political activities of the inhabitants of this extensive Bronze Age town. This project will examine such evidence in detail, and publish it in the form of a substantial, amply illustrated book. It will provide important new information on the nature of urban development, shed light on the nature of inter-community relations in the east of the island in a key period of change, and situate Palaikastro in its wider Aegean and Mediterranean contexts.\\n\\nArchaeologists at Palaikastro have uncovered a number of town blocks, with excavation campaigns in 1902-06, 1962-63, 1986-96 and 2003. Block M was first named as such in 1902-06, but was only properly excavated in the 1990s. It is quite unique at Palaikastro because of its excellent preservation of remains dating to the Neopalatial period, c. 1750-1500 BC, which was the peak of settlement at the site. Unlike many of the town buildings, which are subsequently reoccupied in the three centuries that follow (1500-1200 BC), Block M sees almost no reoccupation. This means that the Neopalatial remains are in many cases undisturbed, and its main structure / Building 6 / is among the best preserved of this period anywhere on the site. Furthermore, Block M has also revealed significant traces of the preceding Protopalatial period (1950-1750 BC), which is also only patchily known at Palaikastro, and indeed across east Crete more generally. Therefore Block M has a great deal to tell us about these two key periods, which mark the emergence of the first palatial centres and state polities anywhere in Europe, their remarkable development and expansion, and ultimately their demise. \\n\\nWhen we look in more detail, this trajectory is nowhere better encapsulated than in Block M. Although much of the area is evidently occupied in the Protopalatial, it is only in the first phase of the Neopalatial period that a truly substantial building is erected. This structure / Building 6 / incorporates the only example known from Palaikastro of a 'Minoan Hall', an architectural feature much more commonly encountered in central Crete. The building then sees some modifications in the next ceramic phase, but is soon destroyed, seemingly by an earthquake. What is unusual is that the building is then never reconstructed, appearing to lie abandoned, with perhaps some sporadic use among the ruins; and this at what is commonly thought to be the acme of Minoan power. It is not long before the Theran eruption occurs (c.1600 BC), and there is speculation that a tsunami could have hit the site. However, Building 6 was already out of action, as we can judge by the accumulation of volcanic ashfall, 20cm deep in places, and some certainly water-borne, inside and outside Block M. In the next phase, the last before the ultimate collapse of the Minoan palace-states, Block M seems to be nothing more than an empty plot with an enclosure wall and two deep wells, probably sunk soon after the eruption in a quest for uncontaminated drinking water.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": null, "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF", "text": "Archaeology", "percentage": 0}]}, "researchTopics": {"researchTopic": [{"id": "14AE809A-4116-46B5-ABF7-DF8BCE2BF069", "text": "Prehistoric Archaeology", "percentage": 0}]}, "rcukProgrammes": {"rcukProgramme": []}, "start": null, "end": null, "participantValues": null}, {"links": {"link": [{"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/564489BC-2142-40EF-80D6-E8D82650120A", "rel": "PI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/DB9FF81B-45C1-4C92-850E-2543443F627C", "rel": "COI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/88C5F7F9-8DCC-41C9-BC4F-F37DA01075C7", "rel": "LEAD_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/B8480401-8DDE-472E-9BFB-13DEC29BD816", "rel": "PP_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/funds/AE3D1AE3-2243-4F19-9159-7D444374ED1E", "rel": "FUND", "start": 1539471600000, "end": 1665615600000, "otherAttributes": {}}]}, "ext": null, "id": "682159AA-E3AA-4CEF-8AB8-948B05D262F8", "outcomeid": null, "href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/projects/682159AA-E3AA-4CEF-8AB8-948B05D262F8", "created": 1582643293000, "updated": null, "identifiers": {"identifier": [{"value": "AH/R013845/1", "type": "RCUK"}]}, "title": "(NSF/SBE-RCUK) Rise of divine lordships in the ancient Andes: ancestors and polity in northern Peru", "status": "Active", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Sainsbury Research Unit", "abstractText": "Divine lordships characterised much of western South America when the Europeans arrived in the 16th century. These native polities featured social ranking and kin-based lineages centred on special leaders who held power as god-like, ancestral beings. Despite the prevalence of divine lordships across the world, very little is known about their emergence.\n\nOur project investigates the early record of divine lordship in ancient Peru. It grows out of our previous work which independently observed evidence of political centralisation in two adjacent areas of northern Ancash: districts of Moro (Nepe&ntilde;a coastal midvalley) &amp; Cabana (highland Pallasca). This project aims to more fully document the process of centralisation (AD 1-200), and postulates that four main factors were crucial: intensified resource control; warrior leadership; rival factions; ancestralisation of leaders. Data to test these factors will be acquired through a 4-year plan of fieldwork and analysis, including:\n\nA) Regional Settlement Survey. Social complexity models have tended to focus on single valleys. We examine adjacent valleys to widen the frame of analysis to observe larger scale systemic change. Each basin is dominated by an impressive hilltop centre, Cerro San Isidro (Moro) &amp; Pashash (Cabana), which overlooks valuable lands and features commoner and elite dwellings, fortifications and mausolea. Surrounding them are many other settlements and features (hamlets, fields, roads, canals). Detailed survey will help determine their dating, activities and functional relationships to the centres.\n\nB) Excavations at Cerro San Isidro &amp; Pashash. Both sites show excellent archaeological preservation; because new residential and mortuary buildings appear in both areas almost simultaneously, our project can clarify their co-development. Lordships should show evidence of segmentary organisation, ancestor veneration and wealth differences. We aim to study these patterns in large compounds, as palatial spaces of in groups at the seats of power. Burials and mausolea inside them may indicate 'living with the dead,' ritual practices that helped legitimise increasingly powerful noble groups. Post-excavation analyses (organic &amp; non-organic remains) should show variability in diet, wealth accumulation and trade items.\n\nThe project is led by two mid-career archaeologists, who combine four decades of work in Peru and accomplished records of major field projects and outputs in the study areas. A postdoctoral researcher will complement the team to bridge the case studies during fieldwork, heading activities in impact/dissemination, and developing personal research topics on social complexity and material culture. The project will have two Peruvian co-directors, local research technicians and international student participation, while working with local authorities, towns and museums. \n\nOverall, our project researches the rise of Andean polities as part of large-scale, regional systemic change in northern Peru. It develops the material record for early divine lordships and contributes directly to general theory about the emergence of social complexity in the Americas and beyond. It examines topical themes in the sciences and humanities, and resonates with current events - charismatic leadership; wealth inequality; conflict; political ideology.\n\nKey scholarly outputs include new case studies and technical data for two understudied regions, as well as joint publications (books/articles), presentations, meetings and outreach. Wider impact includes capacity-building in Peru: adding collections and sharing data with three regional museums; transferring knowledge for site protection, heritage management &amp; public exhibitions; enabling local museums and stakeholders to know and present their past effectively. It also offers numerous student &amp; researcher opportunities to help develop a new generation of scholars and grow academic and public links between UK, North America and Peru.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "Our project has two principal domains for impact: [1] public outreach activities in the UK &amp; USA; [2] economic input, capacity-building activities and public outreach in Peru.\n\n[1] Project results will be disseminated to general audiences in the UK &amp; USA through presentations in education/lecture programmes (e.g., Norwich, London, Cambridge). News, informal updates and video clips about events and discoveries can be posted through a staff-maintained online blog, social media and distribution lists (with possible coverage by international news and documentary media, if appropriate). \n\n[2] Our impact in Peru highlights three main categories: a) economic assistance; b) archaeological capacity-building; c) outreach &amp; networking.\n\n2a. As the study cases are in poor rural provinces, our presence immediately brings local economic benefit over the fieldwork period (principally labourer wages, facilities &amp; equipment hire, food, incidentals). The project also employs two professional Peruvian archaeologists as co-directors.\n\n2b. Over the long-term, the project helps establish pathways for capacity-building. As all project finds must remain in Peru, their final repositories will be at three regional archaeology museums. They become significant collections, permanent resources available for future study, exhibition and stimuli for Peruvians to learn and engage with the past.\n\nThe integrity of both case study sites is under perpetual threat by development, vandalism, natural erosion and looting (see URLs in 'Pathways to Impact'). Systematic, technical knowledge of their archaeology is the first step for planning their protection and upkeep in conjunction with nearby communities and townships. Direct project contributions include: mapping the off-limits zones; site reports; and consultations on improving protection and heritage infrastructure (e.g., signage, paths, fencing, conservation).\n\nThese activities will stimulate tourism initiatives of the provincial municipalities, rural groups (adjacent to sites) and private enterprises. Both sites are visually impressive and accessible with automobiles, and thus can be easily incorporated into touristic circuits. The other pathway for long-term benefit concerns developing local crafts/souvenirs and foods for visitors. Each field season, we will arrange for a consultation session with each municipality and potential stakeholders (potters, women's groups, tour companies, food/drink outlets); ultimately, such capacity is to foster self-reliance and sustainability.\n\n2c. Peruvians take great interest and regional pride in their millenary past, and project activities will be sure to have newspaper, radio and television news coverage at local &amp; national levels. Presentations (2 annually, 6 total) and site tours will be given to townspeople, and news- and school-groups to inform of field activities, the value of archaeology and archaeological heritage, and their role in the future. With the finds and project team already on hand, the local museums also serve as key venues for additional outreach and presentations, formal and informal. In years 3-4, project staff, with local archaeology BA students, will oversee temporary exhibitions and posters at the museums, to highlight the richness and potential of local archaeology. \n\nFinally, development of education networks is essential. The project provides unique work and travel opportunities for international students, drawn from a range of fields, not just archaeology. We will also secure partner links with universities in Lima, Huaraz and Trujillo to help promote training and professional opportunities, and as an investment for enduring UK-USA-Peru interchanges.\n\nThese activities balance academic and public interests, with the project at the centre of working synergies between different institutions (academic &amp; museums), town/rural communities and private enterprises. They will result in mutual benefits over the short- and long-term.", "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF", "text": "Archaeology", "percentage": 0}]}, "researchTopics": {"researchTopic": [{"id": "14AE809A-4116-46B5-ABF7-DF8BCE2BF069", "text": "Prehistoric Archaeology", "percentage": 0}]}, "rcukProgrammes": {"rcukProgramme": []}, "start": null, "end": null, "participantValues": null}, {"links": {"link": [{"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/1F660A27-835C-4B8F-9057-A07DC47C1265", "rel": "PI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/EC825258-56A6-4F8A-94F6-B6141384EACD", "rel": "COI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/493BB920-4566-4D10-9047-550E9F71C46E", "rel": "COI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/8319F78A-DCBD-49F6-BE00-78E1CD75CDA9", "rel": "LEAD_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/funds/B2FB04AC-BA5C-49C2-BF8C-C8256454BBBC", "rel": "FUND", "start": 1522537200000, "end": 1601420400000, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/disseminations/C0F76224-25E9-4078-BD83-14B36B8A4F8E", "rel": "DISSEMINATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/disseminations/936C9D19-71EA-4584-B2AF-013BCBB20E44", "rel": "DISSEMINATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/C326856F-8B45-4AC1-AC95-C937C825F4D1", "rel": "PUBLICATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/87142463-85E8-4136-947B-A214F95BEB27", "rel": "PUBLICATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}]}, "ext": null, "id": "47102181-A906-4503-865E-14BE5D00B8F7", "outcomeid": null, "href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/projects/47102181-A906-4503-865E-14BE5D00B8F7", "created": 1582643293000, "updated": null, "identifiers": {"identifier": [{"value": "AH/R002622/1", "type": "RCUK"}]}, "title": "Counter Culture: investigating Neolithic social diversity", "status": "Active", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Archaeology", "abstractText": "The aim of this project is to reveal the forms and extent of social diversity amongst the earliest farmers of central Europe, in order to provide new avenues to investigate the history of social inequality. \n\nThe first farmers appeared in central Europe in the Neolithic, a period around 7500 years ago. This so-called 'agricultural revolution' was the crucible of many present day inequalities, such as unequal access to food and good health. Despite the apparent importance of the agricultural revolution to the history of social inequality, we know remarkably little about how and why it developed across the course of the Neolithic. It has long been assumed that beyond the initial transition to farming, the Neolithic could be characterised as a steady, stable and unbroken growth of population and hierarchy, supported by a gradually intensifying agriculture. \n\nTwo recent developments in research demand that we think again about how social diversity, and by implication inequalities, rose, fell and persisted across the Neolithic. First, statistical modelling of radiocarbon dates have produced a chronology refined to human generations, allowing for a fine-grained understanding of social change to be developed. This research has overturned the perception of steady growth. Periods of rapid expansion, collapse, contraction, and breaks in the sequence must now be accounted for and, above all, explained. Second, a suite of new bioarchaeological methods allow archaeologists to capture diversity in human lifeways, by analysing how mobility, diet, daily activities and kinship varied between the sexes, ages and different sections of Neolithic society. By interpreting these two data streams in context with the funerary rites, diversity across the population can be revealed. \n\nThe project will take as its focus the Early and Middle Neolithic in Alsace (c.5300-4300 cal BC). Forming a well-defined and coherent geographical area, this region now has a high resolution and precise chronology for the period under study. Neolithic lifeways in Alsace will be captured through integrating the results from high resolution strontium isotope, stable isotope analysis and dental calculus analysis, with the existing osteological information and evidence from burial rites. Strontium isotope analysis will reveal human mobility patterns in adolescence and whether individuals moved between childhood and their place of burial. Stable isotope analysis will provide insights into diversity in diet between the ages and sexes. The investigation of dental calculus will permit the investigation of daily activities and reveal further details about diet, by analysing the mircofossils preserved in dental plaque. These new analyses will then be interpreted in context with information drawn from the human skeleton and burial practices. \n\nThe project will thus characterise social diversity across a millennia in the Neolithic of central Europe, analysing how diet, mobility and health, as proxies for lifeways, varied in time and between different individual, cemeteries, settlements and cultural groups. It will then build on these data to ask what are the principal characteristics of Neolithic social diversity (age, sex, social group, or culture), and what was the history of Neolithic social inequality, does it increase, decrease or persist through time? \n\nOur results will be disseminated via open access journal articles, conference presentations, a website with blog, associated social media, and downloadable resources and events for the public and interest groups. The project will benefit the scholarly study of the Neolithic, and of the history of social inequality more broadly. Its application in events and resources for children and local communities will aid the effort to improve understanding of the complex experience of social diversity in today's world of growing social inequality, global mobility and culture contact.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "This project will have impact by increasing the engagement with and understanding of prehistoric life, specifically in the Neolithic period. This will be achieved through: (i) the PI's existing impact programme, which has been built around engaging school age children and the general public with Neolithic diet and its diversity, primarily through experimental Neolithic cheese making, and (ii) developing a new stream of impact activities engaging the public with the history of social diversity and inequality. \nWe have identified the following general and specific beneficiaries outside the academic community:\n(1) Children and teachers participating in the UK Key Stage 2 curriculum (ages 7-11) and particularly York school children (aged 5-14),\n(2) Stonehenge Visitor Centre exhibition staff and volunteers,\n(3) General public, especially those attending the York Festival of Ideas 2019, the Festival of Archaeology in 2018, 2019 and the Stonehenge Visitor Centre in 2018.\n\nHow they will benefit:\n(i) Engaging school age children and the general public with Neolithic diet\nThere is huge public interest in the links between diet and health, with the diet of past populations often held up as closer to a &quot;natural&quot; diet (e.g. &quot;Paleo Diet&quot;). The onset of the Neolithic and the changes in diet associated with it, problematise the existence of a &quot;natural&quot; diet, as well as challenging the concept of an &quot;ideal diet&quot;. It also demonstrates the extent to which social identity can be experienced through food. Cheese consumption and its development in the Neolithic has proved a very engaging route into discussing what constitutes a &quot;natural&quot; diet with the public, as it allows them access to the key changes across the Neolithic (such as arrival of dairy resources, living with domestic animals and associated technological changes). Children and teachers in the UK participating in the KS2 curriculum will benefit through the provision of free, downloadable, research-led resources supporting the topic &quot;Changes in Britain from the Stone Age to the Iron Age&quot;. The focus for the resources will be on exploring the social and dietary changes that occurred when farming began, and will complement and enhance what they learn at school. York children aged 5 to 14 will further benefit through an opportunity to be inspired and challenged by an out-of-school learning activity led by the Children's University which will complement their in-school learning. English Heritage exhibition staff and volunteers at the Stonehenge Visitor Centre will benefit through the provision of a day-long continuous professional development opportunity, providing bespoke research-led training which will enhance and complement an ongoing exhibition at the centre. From October 2017 to October 2018, the Stonehenge Visitor Centre will host an exhibition on Neolithic diet and farming. The exhibition will be supported by providing staff and volunteers with the training to communicate the latest archaeological thinking and scientific techniques to the public. \n\n(ii) Developing a new stream of impact activities engaging the public with the history of social diversity and inequality\nThe project will seek to stimulate public debate in issues around social diversity and to uncover what diversity means to the project's varied audiences, by encouraging members of public to engage with the progress and results of the project.

This pathway to impact will be supported by the creation of a website, blog and social media accounts (Facebook &amp; Twitter, following Dept. of Arch, UoY guidelines).

Images carved on rock are generally abstract in nature (so-called 'cup and ring marks'), and the chronological date of these images remains unknown. Scholars have debated their date, assuming either origins in the Neolithic or Bronze Age. A field project, based in the Kilmartin region, Argyll, Scotland set out to examine the issue of dating in the richest rock art landscape in the British Isles. Excavations around two rock art sites at Torbhlaren from 2004-2007 revealed several phases of activity associated with one of the sites, and potential evidence for prehistoric quarrying associated with the other site. An extensive assemblage of stone tools was excavated, both on the stone built platform surrounding one of the sites, and deposited in the rock fissures at both sites. The sites are unique in terms of the British Isles in producing this kind of material. The sites are therefore of national and international significance as they help us to understand the kinds of activity associated with prehistoric rock art, while excavated charcoal samples have the potential to provide radiocarbon dates. These would be among the first radiocarbon dates to be obtained from a British prehistoric rock art site. \\n\\nRecording rock art: The rock art motifs at the sites were only partially recorded by the Royal Commission for Ancient and Historic Monuments Scotland (RCAHMS), and additional motifs were discovered during the field project. The motifs on the rock were re-recorded as part of the field project using an innovative technique, which allows them to be manipulated in a Computer Aided Design (CAD) package. Given the significance of the excavated material it is imperative that an accurate record of the rock art is related to the excavated features. \\n\\nProposed research: Excavations were completed in 2007 and the aim of the proposed project is to analyse the materials recovered from excavation, collate the results and publish the sites. The main analyses which need to be conducted are: 1. The publication and analysis of the sites in their regional landscape contexts. 2. Charcoal analysis and radiocarbon dating. 3. Stone tool analysis, to determine the function and purpose of the tools excavated from the rock art sites and their relationship to rock art production. 4. Reconstruction of the environmental context of the site, as the sites sit in a river valley it is important to determine their relationship to the local river, the River Add, in prehistory; also to determine whether the rock outcrops on which the art is carved are unusual for the region; and to relate buried soil associated with the sites to the pollen record for the region. 5. To produce a visual record of the rock art and its relationship to excavated features to compliment the written record. This is to be achieved by harmonising site records with the CAD images of rock art motifs to produce a full and accurate visual record of the sites. \\n\\n", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": null, "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF", "text": "Archaeology", "percentage": 0}]}, "researchTopics": {"researchTopic": [{"id": "14AE809A-4116-46B5-ABF7-DF8BCE2BF069", "text": "Prehistoric Archaeology", "percentage": 0}]}, "rcukProgrammes": {"rcukProgramme": []}, "start": null, "end": null, "participantValues": null}, {"links": {"link": [{"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/71F292F0-2A86-457E-930C-62D40478B23F", "rel": "PI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/D1774113-D5D2-4B7C-A412-66A90FE4B96F", "rel": "LEAD_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/funds/8AFA384D-249A-4351-B252-BF92BB0E2A18", "rel": "FUND", "start": 1230768000000, "end": 1238454000000, "otherAttributes": {}}]}, "ext": null, "id": "88460ED6-E31D-45DF-B782-D487376D8525", "outcomeid": null, "href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/projects/88460ED6-E31D-45DF-B782-D487376D8525", "created": 1582643293000, "updated": null, "identifiers": {"identifier": [{"value": "AH/G007039/1", "type": "RCUK"}]}, "title": "The landscape(s) of the body: the investigation of the spread of cremation practices during the Middle Bronze Age in Europe", "status": "Closed", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Archaeology", "abstractText": "In the later Bronze Age almost all of Central Europe had 'converted' from inhumation to cremation burial rituals. This change is commonly associated with the spread of the 'Urnfield culture', known through numerous cemeteries of cremation burials in urns. This change, while poorly understood, raises significant questions about cultural change at the most fundamental level of society - its attitude towards death and the status of the deceased body. The shift in burial ritual took place in tandem with broad social and political changes, and the period presents us with a remarkable reflection of change in the integration of the individual within various social structures. Amongst these changes the transformation in attitudes towards the body, which cremation represents, is a particularly central shift. The period of leave will be used to prepare the publication of new comparative research into these changes. \\n\\nIn contrast to previous explanations, this new analysis argues that the change was as much about new understandings of the body as about 'religion' or ideology in a modern sense. It is based on extensive case-study analysis of cemeteries throughout central and northern Europe. The central question considered is what it meant to go from a world in which the body was buried intact and displayed with fineries, pottery and clothing to one in which the dead body is cremated and then buried? \\n\\nTo answer this question, a substantial number of Middle Bronze Age cremation cemeteries have been investigated. The case studies demonstrate that rather than being a swift and coherent horizon of change, the full adaptation of cremation takes time and follows different trajectories. Moreover, there was considerable local experimentation and apparent concern with finding a new physical form for the burials and with the redefinition of the cremated bones as some kind of corporeal substance. While the expression of these concerns varies, they are recurrent themes in all the regional studies. The analysis has also revealed in details how existing local traditions inform and shape the ways in which the innovative elements are being incorporated. Two features stand out in these processes. One is the recurrent evidence of how the attempts at formulating a proper but new burial tradition draws on existing local building traditions as these provide practical technological 'answers' to how a burial is built and shaped. The other is how the drawing of associations between the presentation of the living and the deceased body, such as the ability to use jewellery or the need for food, helps to reconstitute the fragmented cremated bones as a corporeal body. These are significant results as they questions traditional interpretation that saw the spread of cremation as the diffusion of a standard set of ideas and practices.\\n\\nThe monograph will radically revise our understanding of the spread of cremation. It will introduce the local cultural context as a crucial influence on how the idea of cremation is locally absorbed and adapted. It will also provide a rich range of examples arguing that the understanding of the deceased body is articulated through contemporary embodied understandings of the human form. It will argue that this way of perceiving the body was finally broken with the full and standardised development of cremation im urns.\\n\\nThe volume uses the changing attitudes to and treatment of the body as a cross-cutting theme; the analysis and discussion are therefore explicitly concerned with the concrete observable consequences and impacts of the new burial rites. Through this focus, the classic question of the spread of cremation can be discussed through a radically altered lens of inquiry and the resolution will be at the level of what actually happens, while at the same time common trends and tendencies will be acknowledged and articulated through the systematic comparison between case studies.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": null, "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF", "text": "Archaeology", "percentage": 0}]}, "researchTopics": {"researchTopic": [{"id": "14AE809A-4116-46B5-ABF7-DF8BCE2BF069", "text": "Prehistoric Archaeology", "percentage": 0}]}, "rcukProgrammes": {"rcukProgramme": []}, "start": null, "end": null, "participantValues": null}, {"links": {"link": [{"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/BB1AB88B-3029-4269-B367-2A3C325413DD", "rel": "PI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/8783F892-14D8-4465-B1CB-73D78EE5C571", "rel": "RESEARCH_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/D1774113-D5D2-4B7C-A412-66A90FE4B96F", "rel": "LEAD_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/CF11C8EB-DE92-4FC8-8F5D-477390597C44", "rel": "PP_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/funds/44EF8438-D9B8-4DEB-9CE0-8BAD2CD08D60", "rel": "FUND", "start": 1188601200000, "end": 1262217600000, "otherAttributes": {}}]}, "ext": null, "id": "C0FEAF06-7243-44A3-B454-9AC838775993", "outcomeid": null, "href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/projects/C0FEAF06-7243-44A3-B454-9AC838775993", "created": 1582643293000, "updated": null, "identifiers": {"identifier": [{"value": "AH/E00783X/1", "type": "RCUK"}]}, "title": "Exploring a vanished coastal landscape in Holocene Southern Calabria", "status": "Closed", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "McDonald Institute Archaeological Res.", "abstractText": "This research investigates the loss of coastline over the last 10,000 years, and its significance for our understanding of prehistoric societies. As polar ice caps melted at the end of the Pleistocene, global sea levels rose, drowning coastal environments. Archaeologists have assumed that sea levels reached approximately their modern levels by about 6000 BC -- the beginning of the Neolithic in the Central Mediterranean. However, mounting geological evidence shows this to be false, particularly in tectonically active areas where submerged landscapes may be lifted above sea level or coastal zones may sink below it. \\n For archaeologists investigating prehistoric worlds, subsidence and submerged landscapes are a critical problem. Coastlines structure human life: they afford access to marine resources, allow travel and inter-regional contact, concentrate population, and furnish points of reference in cultural landscapes. In Central Mediterranean prehistory, losing a coastline seriously affects our view of central theoretical issues, including Mesolithic forager presence, the spread of the Neolithic, and inter-regional exchange throughout prehistory.\\n Although the problem has been outlined in general terms, it has never been the subject of detailed research in a particular prehistoric landscape. We have little idea how it actually affects our view of Mediterranean prehistory. This situation was demonstrated dramatically in 2005, during research by the Bova Marina Archaeological Project in Calabria, Italy. During underwater geological reconnaissance, a submerged peat deposit with terrestrial wood, plant remains and charcoal was found at 27 metres underwater and 400 metres offshore. A wood sample from it was dated radiometrically to ca. 4000 BCcal / the Final Neolithic here. This striking finding has two key implications:\\n (a) well after post-glacial sea level rise, the coastline here has been sinking below the sea due to local tectonics at about .7 mm/year. Not only have the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic coastlines been submerged, but the Neolithic one has too, and this effect may extend well into the later prehistory. \\n (b) more positively, tectonic failure may have removed coastal landscapes rapidly below wave destruction, and there is potential for well-preserved, underwater natural settings or prehistoric sites with rich organic preservation.\\n The goals of this research are to trace the history of the coastline in this area, the San Pasquale river valley mouth (Bova Marina, Calabria) in more detail than has ever been attempted for the Central Mediterranean. The research team includes J. Robb (Cambridge), a specialist in the later prehistory of the Central Mediterranean, and E. Reinhardt (McMaster University), a specialist in underwater environmental reconstruction. A detailed bathymetric survey and sub-bottom CHIRP prospection will outline the sea floor's morphology in detail to identify geological features and to track evolving coastal environments / lagoons, marshes, river channels -- as sea levels rose relative to land. Geological sampling and coring will provide material for sedimentological, palynological, and geochemical analysis for reconstructing past environments, as well as samples for radiometric dating of ancient coastlines. Special attention will be paid to potential anthropogenic environments, landscape features and artefacts. All information will be integrated using GIS to produce detailed environmental reconstructions for this section of the Southern Italian coastline between 6000 and 0 BCcal. The resulting picture of coastal evolution will be integrated with local prehistory known from BMAP excavations and field survey to understand how the loss, and potential recovery, of the coastline alters our understanding of social phenomena such as local Mesolithic presence, the Mesolithic-Neolithic transition, the Neolithic coastal obsidian trade, and Bronze Age regional interaction (for instance, in Mycenaean trade).", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": null, "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF", "text": "Archaeology", "percentage": 0}]}, "researchTopics": {"researchTopic": [{"id": "14AE809A-4116-46B5-ABF7-DF8BCE2BF069", "text": "Prehistoric Archaeology", "percentage": 0}]}, "rcukProgrammes": {"rcukProgramme": []}, "start": null, "end": null, "participantValues": null}, {"links": {"link": [{"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/0EF34937-BDE1-4D84-BA12-F798ECFA1776", "rel": "PI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/949E2D83-615F-45B4-AD1C-5B2753E50FDE", "rel": "COI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/12B3B4A4-C507-4973-8A30-05B8EB12DFFE", "rel": "COI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/44D22548-7A50-4D06-AE6C-A931D144E940", "rel": "COI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/5D588F11-010A-4DD3-A100-871D7C7E6BE9", "rel": "RESEARCH_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/1F660A27-835C-4B8F-9057-A07DC47C1265", "rel": "RESEARCH_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/F65D52B1-5059-43F6-BE03-9132E1FF8F5C", "rel": "RESEARCH_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/9C10D78F-6430-4CA7-9528-B96B0762A4C6", "rel": "LEAD_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/funds/C23678E0-2083-49E0-8D3E-A21ABD62C00E", "rel": "FUND", "start": 1222815600000, "end": 1330473600000, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/keyfindings/998DA510-127C-4EAE-8D7C-0C6DCF9232D1", "rel": "KEY_FINDING", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/furtherfundings/FF9EC81B-2BE2-4C34-9088-64EC6C35A251", "rel": "FURTHER_FUNDING", "start": 1335826800000, "end": 1491087600000, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/furtherfundings/AC598427-3DBF-4373-B575-435AAE3BD396", "rel": "FURTHER_FUNDING", "start": 1335826800000, "end": 1491087600000, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/C26FD347-111E-4CFB-B71A-863DE7AA3D42", "rel": "PUBLICATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/996B2DED-1B23-4379-B835-254B54C34292", "rel": "PUBLICATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/200B3420-784F-4FA7-960C-C59F435310A6", "rel": "PUBLICATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/4B479C6C-605B-47C9-8DA3-7B9A33C0A774", "rel": "PUBLICATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/67AE7BA9-36D8-4F15-AF84-13F090221177", "rel": "PUBLICATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/4EB8DB2B-6145-405A-A204-43CB658552E1", "rel": "PUBLICATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}]}, "ext": null, "id": "B0B51B86-E136-4CD5-9A50-D90EB00D4AF1", "outcomeid": null, "href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/projects/B0B51B86-E136-4CD5-9A50-D90EB00D4AF1", "created": 1582643293000, "updated": null, "identifiers": {"identifier": [{"value": "AH/F018126/1", "type": "RCUK"}]}, "title": "The first farmers of Central Europe - diversity in LBK lifeways", "status": "Closed", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Sch of History, Archaeology & Religion", "abstractText": "The Linearbandkeramik culture, often abbreviated LBK, is the first Neolithic culture in many parts of central Europe. Dating to roughly 5600-4900 cal BC, it stretches from Hungary to the Paris Basin and from southern Germany into the northern Polish and German plains and Holland. Apart from introducing a farming way of life, the LBK is most notable for the construction of monumental wooden houses, which form the first permanent villages in the area.\\n\\nFor a long time, researchers have treated the LBK as a very uniform culture which spread very quickly from the east by migration and simply displaced the indigenous hunting and gathering population. However, there is now increasing evidence that the situation may have been much more complex, with a mixture of immigration, selective adoption of elements of the farming way of life by indigenous peoples, and fusion between populations. In addition, it seems that Neolithic people may have remained a lot more mobile than previously thought, for example moving with their herds to seasonal or annual rhythms or at significant stages of the lifecourse.\\n\\nIn short, the LBK is much more varied than was once believed, and economic strategies, mobility and nutrition, alongside material culture items such as pottery, house designs and ways of burial, differ both through time and across space. At any one point in time, there may have been considerable economic and ethnic diversity within what were once thought to be homogenous communities. \\nOur study takes this further by combining interpretations of material culture and conventional palaeoeconomic data with new scientific techniques. Isotopes in human and animal teeth and bone, for example, can show whether people and their herds moved between areas with different geologies or water sources (strontium or oxygen isotopes) and what kind of plant food and proteins they consumed (nitrogen, carbon and calcium isotopes; C14 dates to assess importance of fish). We will also carry out osteological investigations on human skeletons to discover more about activity and nutrition.\\n\\nSome studies have already been undertaken in this field, but they have been applied to only very few sites in quite small areas (mostly southwest Germany). This means that their results may not necessarily be true for other regions within the extensive LBK distribution. It has often not been possible to sample many skeletons, and generally only one or two of the techniques have been employed, giving a partial view. As a result, conclusions so far have remained strictly limited.\\n\\nThis project, involving experts from Cardiff, Durham and Oxford Universities, is the first to look at this very detailed level at a much wider area, from the lower Rhine and Alsace, through southern Germany and Austria and into Slovakia and western Hungary. In this way, we will seek to establish regional difference in lifeways within the LBK. We will also sample more skeletons in order better to compare differences in diet and mobility between men and women and between younger and older members of the community. We will investigate whether people who were buried in different locations, such as in cemeteries or in pits in settlements, show differences in nutrition or in the kind of work they did. This can then be combined with a study of material culture patterns, on which there is a rich literature. By using many techniques and approaches in combination, we can achieve a better picture of past life and reconstruct it in much more detail.\\n\\nIn this sense, the project is also a case study in the investigation of diversity within the global Neolithic phenomenon as a whole, where the recognition of difference and local responses to new lifeways is becoming increasingly important.",

"Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Sch of History, Archaeology & Religion", "abstractText": "The CAER (Caerau and Ely Rediscovering) Heritage Project will be a multi-disciplinary, multi-period community project exploring the history and archaeology of settlement, land use, and society in Caerau and Ely (a deprived suburb of Cardiff) and relating this to the wider Cardiff and South Wales region. Set within the local housing estates is the large and unexplored Caerau Iron Age hill fort, inside of which was constructed a medieval ringwork and medieval church. The exploration of this multi-period site represents a highly engaging focal point for the project which it is hoped will also encompass aspects of Ely's history from prehistory through to the 21st century - constructing a broad narrative of the history and archaeology of the Cardiff region through the story of this one significant location. The project will seek to connect the past to the present, making the heritage of the district relevant and important for contemporary communities - creating a heightened sense of place and developing educational opportunities and improving social cohesion and inter-generational contact. \n\nThis project will build on significant engagement work which has already been completed by School of History, Archaeology and Religion with community groups and schools in the Caerau/Ely district of Cardiff and in collaboration with a range of heritage institutions in South East Wales. These include an extensive series of partnership-building meetings held with a significant range of stakeholders including CADW, the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales and the National Museum of Wales together with significant community partners including Communities First, Glyn Derw High School and the Caerau Local History Project. \n\nWithin the contemporary social context, the communities of Caerau and Ely face significant educational barriers at a variety of levels and ages due to a range of social problems. There is also a significant and, to a large extent, exaggerated stigma associated with this area of Cardiff and its problems. Working with local schools and community groups the project aims to address a range of problems in relation to the management, presentation and history of the area and, particularly, the Caerau Iron Age fort, which has never been explored through archaeological or antiquarian research. This constitutes a little known yet extremely valuable and attractive local resource for educational opportunities and for creating a more positive perception of the area and its communities. \n\nA series of heritage based educational activities will take place both on Caerau Hill and the Caerau and Ely locality throughout the oncoming year to explore the area's long and fascinating past. This will be instigated by a week of archaeological activities in March 2012 designed to engage local community youth and school groups as a pilot project. This will gauge local interest for a longer term, sustainable community heritage project or projects. A geophysical survey is proposed during this week along with other archaeological, art and learning activities. All these activities will be tailored to the delivery of basic skills training together with a development of awareness and knowledge about the site. From the outset, the local schools and communities will be involved and invested in answering important research questions about this hugely significant, but under-researched, hill fort.\n\nWe envisage that this will be just the initial phase of a sustainable CAER Heritage project; constituting of a series of pilot activities which will act not only as a stimulus for a sustainable longstanding heritage project in Caerau/Ely but also as a testimonial showcase for SHARE/Cardiff University to build similar heritage partnerships/outreach activities with other communities in South East Wales region and more broadly.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "Who might benefit from this research?\nThe key beneficiaries outside the academic community will be the communities of Caerau/Ely, other communities in deprived areas of Cardiff (via open days/outreach contacts) and much more broadly communities, locally and nationally, via media coverage, museum displays and a web resource. \nKey groups include:\nLocal school children\nUnder-represented groups such as the elderly, BME groups, single mothers\nCommunity workers/teachers\nScout and guide groups\nYoung people, youth groups\n\nHow might they benefit from this research?\nNetworks within the local communities will benefit from an enriched understanding of the past and the creation a heightened sense of place and local identity. In particular, local people will be connected to their heritage through informal/formal educational activities, interpretation events and participant led initiatives. This will help reduce anti-social and negative behaviour on Caerau hill and improve the presentation of the hill fort and surrounding area creating a valuable local and national resource for leisure and learning activities.\n\nBy undertaking multi-period, multi-disciplinary studies, the project aims to engage with a wide range of people from the local communities, and to challenge or change internal and external attitudes towards Caerau and Ely and its communities. Particular benefits will include:\n\nOpportunities for training and development of key skills through an engaging subject specific heritage exploration for local children, young people and adults thereby challenging aspirational poverty and breaking down barriers to education.\n\nTo create lasting links between Caerau and Ely communities, particularly schools and community organisations (e.g. Communities First), with Cardiff University in collaboration with other institutions such as National Museum Wales and CADW.\n\nTo undertake programs of activities with a range of age-groups from different schools to encourage cross-age-group learning, particularly in the transition phase from primary to secondary\n\nA range of focused activities, such as vegetation clearance and ecological artwork, to engage with disadvantaged and under-represented youngsters who are on the fringes of the school system\n\nOpportunities for all members of the local community (young, old, ethnic minorities, scout and guide groups) to work together on specific focused heritage events and develop their own sustainable projects\n\nTo widen access and break down barriers to higher education by arranging visits of local school children to Cardiff University and National Museum Wales, St. Fagans and to bring expertise from those organisations into the Caerau and Ely communities",

technological study of chipped stone", "status": "Closed", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Archaeology", "abstractText": "The first people to live in Scotland arrived around 9000 years ago and lived by hunting and gathering within woodlands that had colonised the landscape after the end of the ice age and on the coasts where many resources including shellfish, fish, sea mammals and seaweed could be exploited. This period of hunting and gathering, referred to as the Mesolithic, continued until farming and Neolithic culture arrived at around 5000 years ago. \\nThe Mesolithic people left few traces of their presence: they did not construct any monumental tombs like those of the following Neolithic period and because they lived nomadic lifestyles their settlements were often ephemeral. Moreover, many of these are now buried below blown sand and peat, while organic remains such as animal bones and wooden artefacts, have rarely survived. The principal type of Mesolithic evidence for archaeologists is the stone tools and the waste from their manufacture. Such tools were primarily made from flint pebbles and used as arrow heads, barbs, knife blades, chisels and awls. They were manufactured in a variety of ways, some of which made very efficient use of the flint pebbles and display high levels of technical skill. Collections of stone artefacts have been excavated from numerous sites throughout the last century, especially in western Scotland. These can be informative about the types of activities that had taken place (by identifying what they were used for), for reconstructing patterns of movement (by tracing raw material sources) and establishing relationships between sites (by comparing the types of tools and the way they were made). \\nSome of the most important Mesolithic sites are the shell middens on the tiny islands of Oronsay and Risga. These have undergone extensive excavations but the thousands of stone tools and pieces of manufacturing waste that were recovered have never been formally studied. This project intends to undertake such work to understand the role these middens played in Mesolithic lifestyles by comparing the tools from Oronsay and Risga to those from other, non-shell midden sites on other islands and the mainland of western Scotland. It will also examine whether the tools suggest that the same people who lived on Oronsay and Risga eventually adopted farming and a Neolithic lifestyle, or whether these developments arose from new people arriving into the region. It will do this by detailed comparisons of the Oronsay and Risga stone tools with those from Neolithic sites. This is time consuming work because more than 20,000 stone artefacts will need to be catalogued, many of which will need to be described in detail within a computerised database. Once complete, comparisons can be made with existing records of stone tool collections from other sites. The Oronsay and Risga stone tools are currently stored at Cambridge and Glasgow Universities but once analysed will be deposited in the National Museum of Scotland for other researchers to access. The research will be published for academic colleagues while informative displays about the Mesolithic will be constructed in local museums, such as on Mull. \\n", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": null, "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF", "text": "Archaeology", "percentage": 0}]}, "researchTopics": {"researchTopic": [{"id": "14AE809A-4116-46B5-ABF7-DF8BCE2BF069", "text": "Prehistoric Archaeology", "percentage": 0}]}, "rcukProgrammes": {"rcukProgramme": []}, "start": null, "end": null, "participantValues": null}, {"links": {"link": [{"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/B0FAD28F-C7ED-480B-AB6D-713403905CB9", "rel": "PI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/8319F78A-DCBD-49F6-BE00-78E1CD75CDA9", "rel": "LEAD_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/EF72BD48-0DF0-4071-B032-4C9249C0E70C", "rel": "PP_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/funds/A3F1B488-775A-44E2-974A-7AB8193B8087", "rel": "FUND", "start": 1188601200000, "end": 1220137200000, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/A679EBED-326E-4A4C-9630-2708136E8053", "rel": "PUBLICATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/CDD64CFA-DBA8-4B65-A9A6-ECB0B4AD8AA0", "rel": "PUBLICATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/684C02BC-1E07-4489-A0B2-655716B04618", "rel": "PUBLICATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/A6079CE1-F875-4BAB-A10C-3E0DF43FB082", "rel": "PUBLICATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}]}, "ext": null, "id": "168D8D09-323C-43F9-AA45-4B5AE105672C", "outcomeid": null, "href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/projects/168D8D09-323C-43F9-AA45-4B5AE105672C", "created": 1582643293000, "updated": null, "identifiers": {"identifier": [{"value": "AH/E009409/1", "type": "RCUK"}]}, "title": "Underwater Cave Excavation in Gibraltar", "status": "Closed", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Archaeology", "abstractText": "For most of human history on this planet over the past 2 million years, sea levels have been substantially lower than the present in response to the expansion of the continental ice sheets. At the maximum of the last glacial period about 20,000 years ago, sea level was 130 m below the present. For most of the period back to 125,000 years ago (the previous period of interglacial climates and high sea levels), sea level fluctuated between 40 and 60 m below the present. A similar pattern can be traced back over at least the past 1 million years. \\n\\nThis large drop in sea level exposed extensive areas of the continental shelf for human settlement, offering potentially more attractive and diverse coastal resources and terrestrial environments than their adjacent hinterlands. Yet, archaeological evidence for the use of coastal areas and marine resources is largely confined to short-lived periods of high sea level, and most of it to the past 6000 years of modern high sea level. This has resulted in a severely distorted view of world prehistory and a belief that marine resources such as molluscs, fish and sea mammals were largely ignored until a very late stage of human development. \\n\\nSignificant advances have been made in the exploration of this underwater realm over the past 20 years in shallow water and in reference to quite recent archaeological sites. But the prevailing archaeological opinion is that we would learn little from exploration of more deeply submerged coastlines that we could not discover more cheaply and with less risk of failure on dry land. \\n\\nA growing number of underwater archaeological finds, the development of new technologies of underwater investigation, and the realisation that a valuable archive of archaeological evidence is being destroyed by erosion and commercial exploitation of the seabed are slowly changing attitudes. Nevertheless the costs and logistical difficulties of underwater investigation continue to pose a significant deterrent to such research, and reinforce the belief that the outcome of such investigations is too uncertain and too speculative to be worth the risk.\\n\\nIn this project we will undertake excavation of underwater caves offshore of Gibraltar and at a depth of 20-25 m, using a diving team trained in mixed gas diving, which allows safe and prolonged working time underwater. We will combine this with mapping of the wider area around the caves using remote sensing equipment to identify the character of the original terrestrial landscape and to place the caves into their wide landscape setting. Ongoing investigations of the famous Gibraltar cave sites on the present-day shoreline, with long sequences extending over the past 125,000 years and numerous remains of Neanderthals will provide additional context and points of reference to place the results of underwater exploration into a wider archaeological context. \\n\\nWe believe that these underwater caves are the only currently known features at this depth anywhere in the world that offer a good prospect of preserving and discovery archaeological deposits, and that they might therefore offer a unique window into human activities on shorelines formed when sea levels were lower than the present.\\n\\nThe results of this work will show whether archaeological deposits are preserved underwater in such conditions, and in what ways any archaeological data recovered from them provides new information about patterns of human occupation of coastlines and use of marine resources during periods of lowered sea level. The work will also provide experience in the development of techniques of underwater archaeological investigation and results that can be built on by other similar projects in other parts of the world. \\n\\nWe expect the results to be of interest to a very wide academic, scientific and public constituency interested in sea-level change and its human impact, and in the reality or otherwise of 'lost underwater civilizations'.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": null, "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF", "text": "Archaeology", "percentage": 0}]}, "researchTopics": {"researchTopic": [{"id": "14AE809A-4116-46B5-ABF7-DF8BCE2BF069", "text": "Prehistoric Archaeology", "percentage": 0}]}, "rcukProgrammes": {"rcukProgramme": []}, "start": null, "end": null, "participantValues": null}, {"links": {"link": [{"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/ADDE0519-B77B-4D79-9DBD-2B80744CFD14", "rel": "PI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/9C10D78F-6430-4CA7-9528-B96B0762A4C6", "rel": "LEAD_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/funds/B55E1A63-B6F0-4074-8655-249E1037F14F", "rel": "FUND", "start": 1204329600000, "end": 1214780400000, "otherAttributes": {}}]}, "ext": null, "id": "F4B32D7A-A38D-4BCD-8E30-E23B2DC076CF", "outcomeid": null, "href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/projects/F4B32D7A-A38D-4BCD-8E30-E23B2DC076CF", "created": 1582643293000, "updated": null, "identifiers": {"identifier": [{"value": "AH/F003064/1", "type": "RCUK"}]}, "title": "Redefining prehistoric pit-huts on a global scale", "status": "Closed", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Sch of History, Archaeology & Religion", "abstractText": "In many prehistoric communities around the world, people lived in small, semi-subterranean pit-huts. Traditionally, archaeologists have interpreted pit-huts as the first sign of settled life, of the shift from a mobile existence of hunting and gathering to the settled life of farming. Recent archaeological excavations and anthropological research have transformed our understanding of community mobility and sedentism and thus have disrupted long-held correlations between architectural form (e.g., a pit-hut) and lifestyle (e.g., settled farming). We are left facing a fundamental question: what are pit-huts? Do they represent mobile or sedentary communities or something else altogether? Because pit-huts occur in many prehistoric cultures, the scale of this question and the consequences of its anwer are signficant.\\n\\nThe present project is the first study to redefine prehistoric pit-huts by taking advantage of most recent research and by comparing the appearance of pit-huts on a global level. This project studies pit-huts from five regions: the Near East (after 10,000 BC), Japan (from 11,000 BC), southeastern Europe (6000-5000 BC), northwestern United States (1600 BC - AD 800), and the Plains of the American Midwest (4000-2500 BC). By comparing the emergence and function of pit-huts from these disparate regions and periods, this project provides a detailed examination of a common phenomenon (pit-huts) from many different environments, periods, geographies, and cultures. By making such comparisons, research will search for and assess common patterns of activity that run through more than one region and which might reflect wider trends in the ways that people behaved and in their solutions to the shared problems of subsistence, survival and being social.\\n\\nResearch is at the heart of a larger debate about how archaeologists understand the degree of mobility (or sedentism) of a prehistoric community. The most recent archaeological and ethnographic work argues that societies do not progress from mobile hunter-gatherers to sedentary farmers and that we can no longer define community lifestyles as either completely mobile or sedentary. In reality, community mobility varies tremendously (e.g., semi-nomadic, semi-sedentary farming) as do the structures and materials that people use to construct their physical surroundings (i.e., architecture). As a result, we can no longer use the the type of architecture (such as pit-huts) as a way to reconstruct how a group behaves (were they mobile or sedentary) or how people made their living (e.g. hunting-gathering or farming).\\n\\nSignificantly, the larger anthropological debate and its conclusions have not been applied to the study of prehistoric architecture in the regions under study. Because archaeologists traditionally interpret pit-huts as the first evidence of sedentism, a better understanding of what pit-huts are sits the core of the larger debate. The problem archaeologists face (and the questions this project proposes to answer) is what was the function of pit-huts and what is their significance within prehistoric communities activities and social structures?\\n\\nThis project takes a global approach and compares the emergence, function, and meaning of pit-huts from five well studied (but seldom compared) regions in which pit-hut sites are widespread and, crucially, where they have been well excavated. The result will be an innovative understanding of a crucial part of our prehistoric past. Significance will be for the five local archaeological sequences, for wider, global patterns of human behaviour, and for the larger debates over community mobility and sedentism.\\n\\nThe project follows my long-term study of European prehistory and prehistoric architecture (manifest in publications and excavations) and will culminate in a book entitled 'An Archaeology of Pit-huts: Beyond Sedentism, Mobility and Landscape&quot;.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": null, "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF", "text": "Archaeology", "percentage": 0}]}, "researchTopics": {"researchTopic": [{"id": "14AE809A-4116-46B5-ABF7-DF8BCE2BF069", "text": "Prehistoric Archaeology", "percentage": 0}]}, "rcukProgrammes": {"rcukProgramme": []}, "start": null, "end": null, "participantValues": null}, {"links": {"link": [{"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/FB2BEE53-C603-4DA8-93A4-5EBCD22E75E8", "rel": "PI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/68D0E3C9-9246-4CFC-B5E9-48584CF82993", "rel": "LEAD_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/funds/B2E92D17-3E4D-4037-BE83-5949A16863FE", "rel": "FUND", "start": 1233878400000, "end": 1244156400000, "otherAttributes": {}}]}, "ext": null, "id": "F232CD59-A31F-4E5F-AEF6-0EE31BE59443", "outcomeid": null, "href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/projects/F232CD59-A31F-4E5F-AEF6-0EE31BE59443", "created": 1582643293000, "updated": null, "identifiers": {"identifier": [{"value": "AH/F015356/1", "type": "RCUK"}]}, "title": "'A forged glamour': landscape, material culture and identity in the Iron Age", "status": "Closed", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Arts Languages and Cultures", "abstractText": "This research examines what identity meant to people in prehistory, and investigates how archaeologists can explore this concept through the study of past places, bodies and objects. \\n\\nIn the 19th and early 20th century, identity was seen as something which could be identified according to race, ethnicity, or culture. Antiquarians and archaeologists therefore developed methods for identifying past peoples on the basis of physiological or cultural criteria, assuming that identities were discrete, singular and static. They produced maps of Iron Age Britain, on which tribal names were matched with bounded culture groups: identified in space and time, on the basis of distinctive funerary rites, artistic styles and artefact types. The 'Arras culture' of East Yorkshire (thought to be synonymous with the tribe of the Parisi) was distinguished by inhumation under square barrows, in cemeteries which included rare but impressive chariot burials and objects decorated with La Tene art. The Continental affinities of this rite were therefore taken as evidence of a 'Celtic' migration into the area. This project shows how the Arras culture was used by British prehistorians to exemplify culture historical models, explaining social change through migration and invasion.\\n\\nWhilst identity was therefore a key issue in studies of this material, no attention was given to how identities were learned and performed, nor how they might change according to context. Working from an interpretative perspective, informed by anthropological analogy, this research proposes that later prehistoric people conceived of their identities through the social relationships from which they were composed. It argues that their sense of self and place may therefore have changed according to what they were doing, where and with whom. I argue that these multiple and contextually contingent senses of identity can be apprehended archaeologically through an integrated study of material culture and landscape. Each chapter therefore explores the reproduction of social relations through a different field of practice: agricultural work, the inhabitation of settlements, funerary rites and ceremonial practices, as well as exchange and mobility in the landscape. \\n\\nThe book therefore evaluates the usefulness of this concept of 'relational identity' through a study of how it was socially structured and reproduced. Analysis moves between long-term historical change and individual events, to show how social lives contributed to distinctive patterns of practice. It shifts from the landscape scale of earthworks and trackways, to the architectural settings of houses and barrows, and finally, intimate stories of individual burials; producing an engaging interpretation of these communities. Its broader aim is to reveal how prehistoric worlds differed to our own, and explore what it meant to be human in the past. \\n\\nThis research arises out of a series of earlier articles which have explored issues of personhood in relation to places and objects. These have been influenced by studies drawn from anthropology and sociology as well as archaeology. It therefore seeks to make a contribution to inter-disciplinary scholarship on the key themes of landscape, material culture and identity, as well as Celtic studies. Whilst the text will be theoretically informed and thoroughly referenced, it will be written and illustrated in a creative manner designed to engage a broad readership.

The buried Neolithic landscape of Herm (Channel Islands)", "status": "Closed", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Archaeology", "abstractText": "Islands have sometimes been described as laboratories for the study of prehistoric societies. They owe this status in part to the frequent presence of an impressive number of visible remains, be they temples (Malta), statues (Easter Island) or tombs (Orkney). The task facing the prehistoric archaeologist is to evaluate how far these impressive remains are the result of exceptional preservation in marginal locations, and how far the very nature of islands has had a major impact in moulding patterns of behaviour different from those of adjacent mainlands.\\n\\nLike Orkney, certain parts of the Channel Islands are renowned for the number of surviving or recorded Neolithic monuments, but in general these are difficult to situate in social terms owing to the absence of corresponding setllement or landscape evidence. An almost unique exception is provided by the northern end of Herm, where an impressive number of tombs fringes a lowland sandy plain. The post-prehistoric sand cover, which measures over a metre in depth, has preserved buried soils (visible in certain exposures), and in particular has protected the land surface on which the megalithic monuments were built. The recorded monuments lie mainly around the edges of the sandy plain, where the sand cover is thin, and further unrecorded monuments probably lie within the plain itself, where only a handful are currently known.\\n\\nThe objective of this project is to examine the land surface buried beneath the sand, using geophysics and test-pitting to map it and to locate settlement activity (in terms of structures and artefacts) and unrecorded monuments. The latter are primarily funerary in nature and the study will enable us to assess whether burial or ceremonial practices were performed within the same areas as everyday settlement, farming and stock-keeping, or whether these activiites were segregated. This is a key question for the proper understanding of prehistoric societies throughout western Europe, but it is very rare to have lowland landscapes that have been preserved from recent agricultural damage. It will enable us to determine whether a case can be made for Herm having been an 'island of the dead' during the Neolithic period, by analogy with islands off the coast of Brittany (and even Scotland) where such claims have recently been made.\\n\\nThe island character of Herm is the crucial background to this enquiry, but the insularity of the Guernsey archipelago (comprising the islands of Guernsey, Herm, Jethou and Sark) was not a static given at this period but was undergoing processes of radical transformation as sea-level rose rapidly. When the first farmers established themselves (c.5000 BC) several of the present-day islands were still joined to each other, and much of the earlier Neolithic land surface has been lost beneath the sea. The drowned landscape is represented today by the extensive offshore skerries (rocky islets) around Herm, many of which appear and disappear with the daily tidal cycle. Modelling the changing topography of the island during early- and mid-Holocene sea-level rise will be an integral part of this project.\\n\\nThough speculative in some respects - we cannot know what lies beneath the sand or the coastal shallows until we have looked - the potential for radical new insights is considerable. We hope to discover well-preserved Neolithic settlements dating back to the initial phase of farming colonisation, and there is a strong likelihood of well-preserved but hitherto unrecorded megalithic monuments beneath the sand. The research potential of a preserved Neolithic land surface in this symbolically charged island setting is exceptional.\\n\\n\\n\\n", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": null, "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF", "text": "Archaeology", "percentage": 0}]}, "researchTopics": {"researchTopic": [{"id": "14AE809A-4116-46B5-ABF7-DF8BCE2BF069", "text": "Prehistoric Archaeology", "percentage": 0}]}, "rcukProgrammes": {"rcukProgramme": []}, "start": null, "end": null, "participantValues": null}]}
