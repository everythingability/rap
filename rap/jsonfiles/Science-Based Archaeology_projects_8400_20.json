It was first excavated in the 1960s, and new excavations have continued since 1993. The site has gained renown for its size (13 ha), its well-preserved mud-brick architecture, and for its dramatic wall paintings and relief sculpture. The c.19m of Neolithic deposits through the East Mound are seminal for our understanding of key developments in Neolithic life from the domestication of cattle and the adoption of a settled way of living, to the invention of pottery and the growth of long-distance trade.\n\nThis project will provide precise dating for the Neolithic occupation at &Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k East, by using Bayesian statistical modelling to combine a series of 650 radiocarbon dates with the detailed stratigraphic record of the modern excavations and, following a rigorous reassessment of the extant archive, with information from key parts of the 1960s sequence. There are two components to this programme: firstly to provide precise dating for a complete section through the East Mound, and secondly to extend the sequence away from this section so that contemporary houses and spaces can be identified and compared. \n\nWith precise calendar dating it will be possible to explore the following research questions:\n\nA. The Pace of Change\nHow long did it take for new innovations - pottery, milking, domestication of cattle, obsidian blade technology etc - to catch on? Do some changes take longer than others? Does change come as a constant, imperceptible stream or as a series of abrupt, punctuated revolutions? Is there any evidence of abrupt change during the '8.2k climatic event'? \n\nB. The Organisation of Society\nWhat did the settlement look like at any one moment in time? How was it organised? What was the nature of contemporary groupings of middens and houses? Did the more elaborate houses adopt innovations thic or ceramic technologies and styles) more quickly/slowly than less elaborate houses? \n\nC. Ritual and Religion\nHow was ritual organised? Did the community have a strong sense of 'history'? At what scale was memory constructed? How long did human skulls circulate before they were re-buried? Were cattle skulls and horns re-cycled over long periods of time? Was there a religious and social revolution half way through the sequence? \nIn general terms, a detailed chronology will allow for the first time a historical narrative to be constructed for a prehistoric tell. Interpreting this in deep prehistory will be a challenge, particularly as only broad comparisons will be possible between our generational sequence and regional comparanda which are, at best, dated to within several centuries. &Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k will be a microscope through which we can examine the origins and development of settled societies. The broader agenda we will consider includes the development and spread of early farming, the emergence of religion, and the development of the conditions that allowed the growth of urbanism.\n\nThis project is undertaken under the auspices of the &Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k Research Project, which is directed by Ian Hodder, with permission from the Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism. It will be published as a monograph by the Cotsen Institute of Archaeology, University of California, Los Angeles. The project also has long-standing engagements with local communities, the wider public generally, the media, museums, commercial companies (sponsors), local and regional governments, and international organizations such as UNESCO. Our overall hopes and expectations are that more finely dated ancient sites will allow understandings of historical processes at a level of detail hitherto only available in recent time periods, with a concomitant positive impact on the levels of attainable generality.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "The proposed research will allow more detailed dating of ancient sites, and so will allow more detailed exploration of 'big questions' such as how the earliest settled communities were organized, what factors lead to increased rates of innovation, and how did humans in the first settled communities respond to climate change? The answers to such questions will have wide impact outside academia because &Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k is a well-known heritage site on the UNESCO World Heritage list, with 25,000 visitors a year to the site and 86,000 visitors to the website (http://www.catalhoyuk.com). The project has worked with a diversity of stakeholder groups since 1993, engaging them in the research process. Through these various engagements, the dating project aims to involve diverse communities in the scientific understanding of the origins of settled life and in the unique cultural achievements expressed at &Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k.\n\nThe results of the project will be disseminated to wider publics in a number of ways. As well as the monograph publication, the results will be incorporated into a popular book written by Ian Hodder to be submitted to Cambridge University Press. Annual Reports will be published in 'Heritage Turkey' and the project's annual Newsletter, which is circulated to commercial sponsors and members of the Friends of &Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k. There are many &Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k videos on YouTube and the project is on social networking sites. It is also often on television. The results from the new project will be incorporated into such programs.\n\nThe &Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k research database has a publically accessible web interface. The aim at the end of the project is to make the whole database available as a 'Living Archive' that integrates excavation data, artefact data, an image database including video and 3D, as well as diaries, published texts, and the results of the dating project. The entire repository will be exposed using Open Linked Data and stored as a long-term archive at the Archaeoloice York, UK.\n\nA wide range of audiences make up the 25,000 annual visitors to the site, half are Turkish and half foreign, and they come from all walks of life. This is the best opportunity to have global impact at multiple levels. Many buy the site guide book that discusses current work and will incorporate the results of the new project. The results will also be included in the on-site panels and in the Visitor Centre, and will impact on new displays in Konya Museum and changes to the important exhibit about &Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k in the national museum in Ankara (which also sells a version of the site guide book).\n\nLocal communities and schools are engaged in the work at &Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k through a number of mechanisms. The &Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k Research Project runs an educational program that involves 600 children annually, and has a series of other initiatives such as village feasts and performances at the site, comics distributed to local villages, and public lectures. These activities will all include the results of the dating project.\n\nThe &Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k Research Project has sponsorship support from a number of major international and Turkish companies. Each year their staff visit the site, mount exhibits about our work in their corporate offices, and include descriptions of the site in their annual reports. &Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k is part of corporate responsibility, and the results of the new dating program will have an impact in these venues.\n\nLocal, regional, and national Governments are closely involved in &Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k, to ensure compliance with both Turkish laws, regulations, and guidelines and UNESCO stipulations. The new dating research will be carried out within these various regulatory frameworks and the results will be disseminated to the various institutions involved. UNESCO continually monitor work at the site and the &Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k Research Project reports back to the World Heritage Committee. The results of the proposed project will be incorporated into these reports.", "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF", "text": "Archaeology", "percentage": 0}]}, "researchTopics": {"researchTopic": [{"id": "59A2A0A2-345A-4E14-85F6-936CA1B268C4", "text": "Science-Based Archaeology", "percentage": 0}, {"id": "14AE809A-4116-46B5-ABF7-DF8BCE2BF069", "text": "Prehistoric Archaeology", "percentage": 0}]}, "rcukProgrammes": {"rcukProgramme": []}, "start": null, "end": null, "participantValues": null}, {"links": {"link": [{"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/C0AF8E02-0EEC-4AA9-A16A-733473BCEE47", "rel": "PI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/68D0E3C9-9246-4CFC-B5E9-48584CF82993", "rel": "LEAD_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/funds/2A74C4E6-5022-4962-82F8-C67EAF11752A", "rel": "FUND", "start": 1158534000000, "end": 1168992000000, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/12E618D0-73BA-4ADA-AAF4-786ECCCA6805", "rel": "PUBLICATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}]}, "ext": null, "id": "6307DB36-8D64-4650-B9F0-80AAD99BB7D2", "outcomeid": null, "href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/projects/6307DB36-8D64-4650-B9F0-80AAD99BB7D2", "created": 1582643293000, "updated": null, "identifiers": {"identifier": [{"value": "AH/D000343/1", "type": "RCUK"}]}, "title": "The socio-political context of technological innovations: the potter's wheel in Bronze Age Greece.", "status": "Closed", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Arts Languages and Cultures", "abstractText": "Thanks to its interdisciplinary, intersecting and complementary nature, this project has wide-ranging benefits both for archaeologists and scientists, including an improved understanding of crucial periods of Cretan prehistory, improved knowledge of ceramic production and organization, and an increased understanding of elite legitimisation strategies within the context of the emergence of the Cretan palaces. Regarding radiography, benefits include a first large-scale application of this technique to the prehistoric Aegean, an assessment of its potential for ceramic studies in the region (and indeed beyond), and a greater exposure and hopefully subsequent awareness of this under-utilised technique. More generally, this project aims to be a demonstration of how to successfully combine scientific and interpretative approaches to gain a better understanding of past societies.\\n\\nIt is commonly recognised that the adoption of technological innovations is primarily governed by socio-political, rather than technical considerations. This also applies to the potter's wheel whose introduction to Crete towards the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age has been argued to be associated with legitimisation strategies of the newly emerging palatial elites. However there has been little understanding of the complexity of the processes involved, such as the speed and magnitude of adoption and the underlying social meanings or practices. Radiographic analysis of Early Minoan III through to Late Minoan IB pottery assemblages from Knossos (Crete) will for the first time provide a reliable basis for a detailed assessment of the nature and extent of the adoption process, and will permit exploration of whether the emerging local elites can be associated with this phenomenon. Regarding technological aspects of radiography, this project will evaluate its application also to finer Cretan clays and will provide a comparison of the power of deduction between standard macroscopic observations and radiography.\\n\\nThus, upon completion of the project, we will have gained detailed knowledge of the development of wheel-made pottery at Knossos (Crete), and will have gained insights into how partially or completely Knossian potters exploited the potential of the potter's wheel. Based upon our knowledge of production and technological change, a re-assessment of the broader socio-political context of the Cretan palaces will have been proposed. Last but not least, the potential of radiography for Aegean studies will have been evaluated (fine vs coarse clays; observation by eye vs scientific analysis) and placed into the context of radiographic analyses worldwide.\\n", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": null, "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects":

"grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Anthropology", "abstractText": "The rise of state societies is one of the major transitions in human prehistory. In mainland Southeast Asia, the origins of state society share similarities with many of the classic states studied worldwide: a background of simpler, loosely-integrated agrarian communities, some of which may have herded livestock or even still hunted and gathered. As people grew in number, specialised in their occupations, and agglomerated over many generations, state societies arose among these locally dense, interdependent populations. \\n\\nEarly states were often hierarchical, but they were also heterogeneous, often cosmopolitan, and composed of specialised socioeconomic groups that both competed and interacted in ways that manifested the state itself. People may have differentiated themselves across multiple dimensions: social spheres, occupations, residential neighbourhoods, and common family links. Among these, it is crucial to understand the role of kinship, which may have been the earliest organising principle of complex societies. As both population size and the scale of social differences grew, differences may have depended less and less on kinship ties, or, alternatively, come to be inherited along kinship lines. In the archaeology of early states, however, such phenomena have been very difficult to study because artefacts and other material remains are indirect evidence with respect to the migrations and differences of people.\\n\\nWhat is needed is direct evidence, from the prehistoric individuals themselves. Within the wider collaborative archaeological project on the origins of Angkor, I seek to measure isotopes in archaeological skeletons from the site of Ban Non Wat, in the Mun Valley of northeast Thailand. Here, the rise of social complexity may have occurred in a context that was often matrilineal (female-centred), which is unusual among pre-state societies. Ban Non Wat features the largest site-sample of human remains yet discovered in prehistoric Southeast Asia. With over six hundred excavated skeletons, ranging from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age to the Iron Age, the sample provides an unprecedented chance to investigate changes in kinship and social differentiation from simple agrarian origins to a complex, hierarchical and specialised society, becoming part of the Angkor civilization. \\n\\nIn samples of tooth enamel, my Ph.D. students and I will measure isotopes (chemical elements with different atomic masses) from hundreds of human skeletons from Ban Non Wat. Strontium isotopes, which differ from place to place, indicate the geographic area from which each person obtained his/her diet during childhood (when the enamel was forming). Carbon and nitrogen isotopes, which we will measure in both bone collagen and tooth enamel, inform about diet. Using radiocarbon dating to refine the chrononology, we will investigate how immigration patterns and diet changed through time, how these changes may have differed among women and men, and how they related to burial positions and artefacts. Such patterns serve as clues to the specialization and/or group affiliation of each individual. \\n\\nBy first identifying locals versus non-locals, we will identify basic aspects of kinship, particularly the immigration of women (patrilocality) versus men (matrilocality) into Ban Non Wat. In addition, by collaborating with colleagues from University of Otago, we will identify correlations through time between the geographic origins of individuals (isotopes), genetic relatedness (skeletal and dental traits), social distinctions (burial treatments, artefacts) and quality of life (skeletal biology) of individuals and groups. In this unique part of the prehistoric world, these multiple lines of evidence will provide an entirely new perspective on crucial social aspects of early state origin, including changes in social differentiation, migration, and kinship through time.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": null, "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []},

"grantCategory": "Fellowship", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Archaeology", "abstractText": "The proposed project is an interdisciplinary investigation of glass and allied vitreous materials in the Mycenaean World, c. 1600-1050 BC. By focusing on the vitreous industries at the palaces of Mycenae and Thebes this study principally aims to provide models for the structure and operation of the vitreous industries and compare technological and economic aspects of their production. \n\nThe technological origins and evolution of glass as an independent material in the Old World are only vaguely known. The mid-second millennium BC sees the appearance of fully-fledged glass industries in the Middle East and Egypt, which has always been associated with the making of glass vessels due to their large scale production. Nevertheless, the Mycenaean glass industry is set apart from its contemporary glass-producing centres due to the almost exclusive manufacture of glass ornaments. Mycenaean glass is mainly found in dark blue and turquoise colour and its forms fall into the iconographic repertoire of the typical Mycenaean jewellery.\n\nDespite evidence of interaction amongst crafts and industries through diverse cultural encounters, the archaeological and to an extent, analytical evidence, has demonstrated an independent operation of glass industries. To date there is little understanding as to whether the Mycenaean glass industry involved primary production. \n\nTo help answer this question, scientific analyses of glass from the Palaces of Mycenae and Thebes will be used to explore the evolutionary stages of Mycenaean glass technology. To allow further comparison the acropolis of Midea in the vicinity of Mycenae and sites in the northern periphery of the Mycenaean dominion, Phokis and Lokris, the Ionian islands, and Cyprus in the far east of the Mycenaean World will also be included. These regions have been selected due to the abundance and diversity of vitreous objects and their involvement in a dynamic trade of goods in the Late Bronze Age.\n\nChemical and microstructural characterisation in conjunction with targeted trace element analysis will be used as a means of characterising raw materials of the widest collection of well-dated glass artefacts across the Mycenaean World. By identifying trace element discriminants in glass raw materials, and linking these to their geological sources, the degree of independence of vitreous industries can be identified. Procurement of raw materials, raw glass, finished glass objects will be examined within the trade networks of vitreous industries in the Near East, Mediterranean and Europe. By tracing the broader cultural contacts amongst Mycenaean palatial states and urban centres in the Aegean, the degree of independence of the Mycenaean glass industry will be defined. This will further elucidate the puzzling infrequence of Mycenaean glass in sites of the Mycenaean periphery or outside the Mycenaean dominion. In addition, patterns of glass exchange will be illustrated, technology transfer and the extent of industrial interaction amongst glass-producing centres will be highlighted and ultimately, an outline of possible monopolies in glass production and circulation will be provided within the economic and administration systems of Mediterranean and Europe in the Late Bronze Age. \n\nThis powerful methodology can delineate specific technological characteristics of concurrent vitreous industries and thus define clear-cut production zones. The research will discriminate amongst industries with similar technological traditions but with divergent practices arising from local environments, diverse cultural contexts, functional needs, ideas and beliefs. Given the absence of securely defined remains of glass workshops in the Old World the research is of crucial significance in Mycenaean and prehistoric studies as well as in ancient glass studies.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "The proposed research will enable a greater understanding of the production and trade of vitreous objects in the Mycenaean period. The research will be conducted in collaboration with a range of museums and archaeological organisations, as well as scientific facilities such as the British Geological Survey at Keyworth (Notts, UK).\n\nThe outcomes of the research will include two articles in key journals used by both academics and museum curators from the museums whose collections are represented in the research sample; a book chapter, a conference paper for the workshop and a single-authored monograph. An edited volume from the workshop (with participants from beyond the academic world) will be completed following the completion of the fellowship. The publications will make previously unpublished data available and will update analysis dating back to the 19th and early 20th centuries, providing a new research resource for museum and conservation professionals dealing with Mycenaean artefacts. The findings will be of great relevance to the interpretation of artefacts within museums holding Mycenaean and Late Bronze Age glass from Meditarranean collections (for example the British Museum, the Petrie Museum in London and the Ashmolean in Oxford) and will have a direct impact on the rearrangement of the permanent exhibition of glass artefacts in the New Archaeological Museum of Thebes.\n\nThe research will also establish a published reference framework for future chemical characterisation and provenancing of vitreous artefacts and is of potential use to non-academic geologists, mineralogists, archaeologists, material specialists and new creative practitioners working with vitreous materials, for example beads.", "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []},

"leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Sch of Computer Science", "abstractText": "This project focuses on harnessing the creative capacities of communities to provide transformational engagements and research production between communities and researchers: to enable (crowd sourced) co-production of heritage data. \n\nUsing photogrammetry techniques, we utilize the ubiquity of the camera (in the hands of the communities) to photograph heritage artefacts and environments that are uploaded to our server, transformed to 3D models (through an automatic and online photogrammetry server), and stored in open file formats, with metadata, and archived in the public HER of Wales, via Archwilio. \n\nThis process preserves 'by record' an archive of 2D photographs and 3D models of the heritage, metadata and their locations. Saving the data in the HER provides long-term sustainability of the data. Focusing on photogrammetry rather than laser scanning enables the co-production of the heritage archive and a broader coverage of the heritage: more objects to be scanned than would be ever possible without the community involvement, and at low cost. \n\nWe will research and develop a 'wikipedia' style moderation structure, enabling experienced users to become moderators, to authenticate and moderate the content, to create a self-moderating and self-sustaining and enduring process. This model will create &quot;heritage-pedians&quot;.\n\nWe will create alternative views: use 3D-printing (rapid prototyping) to generate 3D physical models of the data, and will research how to create a novel multi-touch and tangible tabletop display, that uses the 3d-printed objects as tangible input devices to manipulate and explore the table-top interaction along with multi-touch. I.e., using augmented reality code, the table will notice the presence of a tangible object and alter the content of the visualization based on the object placed on the table. \n\nThe tangible table will form the centrepiece of our exhibition, and enable the public to view and manipulate the information in a novel and exciting way, and enable researchers to discuss and explore different interpretations of the past.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "As the major stakeholder in the project, the potential public impact is particularly significant, and is held to be a major aim of the programme. Beneficiaries can be divided into a series of important sub-groups, all of whom will experience potentially transformational impacts. Schoolchildren partaking in outreach activities will benefit from the educational impact of an increased or entirely new understanding of local and regional prehistoric heritage, teaching them to value their heritage, and laying the foundations for increased engagement in the future. This will be of particular importance for children from socio-economic backgrounds traditionally associated with low educational attainment and lower take-up of further education opportunities in history and the humanities. Given the community-sourced nature of the data collected for the project, it represents an opportunity for the public to engage in a truly democratic manner with their prehistoric past. Through the online sourcing of imagery and artefacts scanning workshops, individuals can decide which sites are to be recorded and digitally preserved, on the basis of what is important to them personally. Volunteers will also benefit from learning new skills and practices in heritage recording. This will foster greater engagement with the heritage of their region, with future benefits for positive stewardship of monuments by their local communities. Benefits therefore accrue for the archaeological resource as a whole. In terms of quality-of-life, through the revolutionary 3D presentation of prehistory, the project represents a unique opportunity for older people or those with mobility-based disabilities to experience heritage that is often rendered inaccessible to them, due to landscape or physical location. On the international stage, the website offers the opportunity for those of any nation to learn about the prehistoric heritage of the UK, and will present a technologically innovative and forward-looking vision of Welsh heritage, with potential impacts on regional tourism.\n\nPublic bodies involved in heritage preservation and policymaking will experience significant positive impacts from the project. The RCHMW/Cadw databases will be enhanced with important 3-dimensional information on the preservation of sites for future management, in addition to the knowledge transfer potential of the photographic recording method itself, for future research or monitoring activities through the rapid recording of threatened sites. The Gwynedd Archaeological Trust (GAT) will receive a more comprehensive record of local prehistoric monuments and sites, enabling more informed local planning decisions, and a better understanding of the safety of the monuments under their oversight. The Welsh Finds scheme (run through GAT), and the public as a whole, has the potential to benefit through the 3D recording of prehistoric artefacts held by individuals, but which would otherwise remain in private collections. There is also the potential for knowledge transfer, to all these bodies, of cutting-edge online search and recording tools, and digital interoperability with their existing online databases.\nMuseums and Museum Professionals\nThere will also be significant impact and knowledge transfer with the museum sector. Obviously Pontio Bangor will benefit from a permanent display as an outcome of the project. The innovation centre will benefit from expert knowledge on cutting-edge interactive presentation techniques, and experience higher visitor footfall overall due to public interest in the project and the sites on display. Additional visitors attracted to local museums stand a much greater chance of visiting the same or other museums in the future, thereby contributing to the sustainability of the entire sector, and of engagement with heritage more generally.", "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id":

"Closed", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Archaeology", "abstractText": "This project is the third in a trilogy of multi-institutional research investigations aimed at revolutionizing our knowledge of Stonehenge: investigating the monumental landscape of Stonehenge (the Stonehenge Riverside Project), the people of Stonehenge (the Beaker People Project), and the economic provisioning for Stonehenge and associated sites (Feeding Stonehenge, this project).\\n\\nThis proposal is for a study of the material resources required for building Stonehenge and the other henge complexes of Wessex. It goes beyond already-completed surface analysis of finds and investigates inside them, using newly developed scientific analyses to find out about the animal, vegetable and mineral resources utilized by these prehistoric people - where the resources were found, how far they were brought, how they were prepared, and how they were consumed and discarded. All the proposed analyses have been trialled by pilot studies to ensure that they will deliver significant findings.\\n\\nStonehenge and its associated sites undoubtedly attracted builders and celebrants from many parts of Neolithic Britain. Until now, archaeologists have only been able to speculate on the size and nature of these sites' catchments and on whether centres such as Avebury and Stonehenge were in competition with each other or were visited at different times in the seasonal round. Isotopic and age analysis of the herds slaughtered for feasting at Durrington Walls and other henges will reveal patterns of rearing, mobility and seasonality to answer these questions. Preliminary investigations have produced unexpected results: they indicate that the animals were brought considerable distances to ceremonial centres.\\n\\nWhile much work has been done on the Welsh bluestones brought to Stonehenge, relatively little attention has been paid to the large sarsens. Excavations at Stonehenge in 2008 have revealed that sarsen-working methods varied within and around the monument, allowing earlier excavation results to be re-assessed, to increase our understanding of the methods, process and techniques of stone-working. From largely forgotten antiquarian observations 300 years ago, some of the quarry sites may have been about 20 miles from Stonehenge, between Avebury and Marlborough. \\n\\nRecent excavations of the Stonehenge people's houses at Durrington Walls will also provide new information: scientific study of the finds will reveal detailed insights into the people's way of life. Geochemical and geophysical analysis of the house floors and yard surfaces will reveal spatial patterns of occupation and activities within a village probably inhabited by the builders of Stonehenge. Combined with the spatial mapping of artefacts, plant remains and animal bones (both large and microscopic), these analyses can reveal how interior and exterior domestic spaces, as well as ceremonial spaces, were used within this short-lived but large settlement occupied for less than 50 years around 2500 BC.\\n\\nStudy of the Durrington Walls settlement's animal bones will indicate dietary preferences, methods of carcass dismemberment and consumption patterns, and reveal differences between small-scale domestic and large-scale ceremonial settings. This settlement was inhabited about 50 years before copper tools are thought to have been adopted in Britain, and there is tantalising evidence that copper axes may have been used at Durrington Walls; the study of cut-marks on animal bones should reveal whether any were made by copper daggers as opposed to flint tools. Study of the hundreds of flint arrowheads, some embedded in pig bones, will reveal patterns of use and breakage as well as variations in manufacture by stone-tool makers with varying knapping skills.\\n\\nThe large quantity of pottery from Durrington Walls can be analysed to find out where it was made and what was cooked in it. Preliminary studies suggest local manufacture from riverine clay; contents included dairy products, pork and beef.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": null, "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF", "text": "Archaeology", "percentage": 0}]}, "researchTopics": {"researchTopic": [{"id": "14AE809A-4116-46B5-ABF7-DF8BCE2BF069", "text": "Prehistoric Archaeology", "percentage": 0}, {"id": "59A2A0A2-345A-4E14-85F6-936CA1B268C4", "text": "Science-Based Archaeology", "percentage": 0}]}, "rcukProgrammes": {"rcukProgramme": []}, "start": null, "end": null, "participantValues": null}, {"links": {"link": [{"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/D4084003-3CF8-4FC5-878C-D1AF8DEDDEF3", "rel": "PI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/D4084003-3CF8-4FC5-878C-D1AF8DEDDEF3", "rel": "FELLOW_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/C878FCF2-A4AB-4905-A2C4-57850B9DC660", "rel": "LEAD_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/C878FCF2-A4AB-4905-A2C4-57850B9DC660", "rel": "FELLOW_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/A75EE2D9-BB53-4E09-8B25-2D8ECC254638", "rel": "PP_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/funds/A6C6F2F1-6EEE-4FD8-B47D-2A73A52C0121", "rel": "FUND", "start": 1347231600000, "end": 1370732400000, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/keyfindings/7915B51D-5728-49F9-A596-C409BB3A1944", "rel": "KEY_FINDING", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/furtherfundings/6F2D8AAE-D60A-43B0-A0B3-2F896BAACF2C", "rel": "FURTHER_FUNDING", "start": 1391212800000, "end": 1517529600000, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/impactsummaries/05D3B10E-E46D-47BF-8E48-71EC228932CE", "rel": "IMPACT_SUMMARY", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/researchdatabaseandmodels/1304EF7D-4DFE-4E5F-AC31-AFC84790E779", "rel": "RESEARCH_DATABASE_AND_MODEL", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/AA048D0B-06B3-4290-A933-CC4D29498B48", "rel": "PUBLICATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/D5A82CE4-77D2-48FE-9EF4-A481051E2D4D", "rel": "PUBLICATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/8103026B-0F27-4F1A-B99A-3A5DC9A8ACA8", "rel": "PUBLICATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/F8CE319A-0529-488B-8854-15A3FEA84B47", "rel": "PUBLICATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/CE4EE722-053A-451E-AE50-B42A27DBEF8D", "rel": "PUBLICATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/141086EE-20E4-4DB4-A922-042B150A21C2", "rel": "PUBLICATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}]}, "ext": null, "id": "F9C4B1F8-96F2-4AF3-9625-1971EC1EEB24", "outcomeid": null, "href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/projects/F9C4B1F8-96F2-4AF3-9625-1971EC1EEB24", "created": 1582643293000, "updated": null, "identifiers": {"identifier": [{"value": "AH/J007846/1", "type": "RCUK"}]}, "title": "The Newport Medieval Sh6ip: Publication, Representation, Dissemination", "status": "Closed", "grantCategory": "Fellowship", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Archaeology and Anthropology", "abstractText": "The Newport Ship is the most substantial medieval ship found in Britain in modern times. Its discovery triggered academic and wider interest and a vigorous, popular campaign leading to its rescue for study, conservation and display. Over the decade since its excavation, a substantial programme of documentation and research has been undertaken at a dedicated ship centre. With conservation under way, and plans for a new museum to exhibit the ship recently announced, authoritative publication of the ship is timely. The intention is to produce a substantial publication telling the story of the discovery of the ship and its original construction, life, and demise, in a form accessible to a wide audience reflecting the level of interest shown since its discovery. Recording the thousands of timbers and other objects associated with the ship has produced an unparalleled archive of three-dimensional drawings and laser scans, photographs and other digital assets. In parallel with traditional publication, this digital archive will be submitted to the Archaeological Data Service, making it available to all researchers via the internet. \nThe ship represents a rare survival of a clinker-built ship of the late medieval period, constructed on the Atlantic seaboard. Over 25m of the original ship was recovered with the dismantled timbers recorded in detail using three-dimensional digital recording technologies providing an unparalleled opportunity to understand arguably the most complex machine in use during the medieval period. Publication brings together the documentation and analysis of the ship itself, and associated assemblages of rigging, rope, leather, textiles, metalwork and other artefacts and environmental material. Given precise dating of the ship's arrival in Newport through dendrochronology, it is possible to place the ship in its particular historical context in the late 15th century.\nThe innovative use of digital technologies in this archaeological project raises challenges with traditional publication while offering opportunities to exploit new modes of dissemination of research through accessible digital archives. The publication of thousands of ship timbers as two-dimensional drawings and formulaic text descriptions would not be appropriate, or sustainable, and degrade the quality of the three-dimensional record produced during documentation. By including these in an accessible digital archive, researchers can access and interrogate the original data in ways not possible through traditional publication, and digital visualisations such as animations can be viewed to enhance interpretation and dissemination of research findings. As such this project seeks to address the highlight notice digital transformations, exploring how engagement with the digital environment, requires adaptation in the ways we hold, share, and present knowledge and research.\nThe synthesis of this research represents a sustained collaboration between the University of Wales Trinity Saint David and the Newport Museum and Heritage service. The integrated publication and archive proposed form an essential stage in the development of a new museum where the ship will be reassembled, displayed and interpreted alongside Newport's other collections.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "The discovery of the Newport ship generated widespread popular interest and a vociferous local campaign which led to the ship's rescue. This popular interest has been maintained over the decade since the ship was excavated through a variety of approaches. The original Save Our Ship campaign group has evolved into a community-based group, the Friends of the Newport Ship, which supports the project through regular newsletters for its large membership, attendance at public events, arrangement of a winter lecture series, and production of popular publications. Heritage Lottery funding allowed establishment of learning and outreach activities associated with the ship, delivered through the Newport Museum and Heritage Service which continues. Beneficiaries include schoolchildren, volunteers and workplace students. Project team staff organise regular open days at the Newport Ship Centre, and deliver frequent public lectures. Previous AHRC funding has allowed research into the ship's original shape through innovative construction of scale models and associated display at the Newport Ship Centre. Present funded research is exploring how digital models of the ship may be used to communicate research findings to a wide audience through use of new multi-touch interfaces.\nThe Newport ship project has therefore established a substantial, non-academic audience and strong community support. Newport City Council has recently announced its intention to develop a new museum in Newport to exhibit the reassembled ship and associated collections. Synthesis and interpretation of research undertaken on the ship over the last decade, and it's deposition in an accessible archive will greatly assist in the development of this museum which is now seen as a key driver in urban regeneration of Newport City.", "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject":

"leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Archaeology", "abstractText": "Stonehenge, Britain's iconic prehistoric monument, continues to fascinate. Thanks to recent research including a new series of excavations undertaken over the last 10 years, the public's appetite for the story of Stonehenge is a voracious as ever, demonstrated by countless documentaries, popular books and a new visitor centre at the site. Here we wish engage new audiences with the remarkable detailed evidence for the consumption of food at Stonehenge, that has recently come to light through the Feeding Stonehenge Project (FSP) funded by the AHRC. Food is central to all our lives, forming the structure of our days and lying at the heart of many social events. At the same time, food is the focus of many health concerns, with advice on the quality, quantity, type and source of food never far from the front page or the screen. This project will tap into this public appetite for all things edible by providing a prehistoric perspective on how foods were treated (acquired, prepared and consumed) in Neolithic Britain. We will show how scientists have made these discoveries through examination and molecular analysis of bones and artefacts, focusing on those recently excavated from the Stonehenge monumental complex. Through these twin core themes (food and science), we aim to substantially extend the reach and significance of the original research. \n\nTo do this we will embed a post-doctoral researcher within English Heritage (EH) during their temporary exhibition &quot;Feast! Food and Feasting at Stonehenge''. As an archaeological scientist, the PDRA will train staff and volunteers, and collaborate with the EH interpretation team to develop creative engagement activities whilst ensuring that these are aligned to the original Feeding Stonehenge research. In addition to the exhibition, we will bring in specialists (food interpreters and artists) and work with the local community to recreate some of the food procurement and culinary practices at the visitor centre through a series of workshops designed to engage the public. Working with the EH educational team and STEM Learning, the largest provider of science education and careers support to schools, we will develop primary and secondary schools resources to enthuse young scientists in the scientific aspects of the original research. Finally, we will create and deliver workshops to engage families adn young people at national cultural events through expertise and networks developed by Cardiff University's outreach group, Guerilla Archaeology. Guerilla Archaeology takes archaeology to new audiences at music festivals; these hugely popular 3-4 day events are fast becoming the most exciting places to creatively engage with research, and provide the potential to bring entirely new audiences to prehistory. Guerilla Archaeology will help us to deliver pop-up, provocative and highly interactive events that make the past present for younger audiences, and stress the important role that both scientific enquiry and cultural reflection can bring to our understanding of ancient, modern and future lives.\n\nWe will evaluate the effectiveness of transferring our key messages to the large number of visitors to the Stonehenge Visitors Centre, festival goers and the local community using embedded evaluation, face to face surveys and online questionnaires. By end of the project, will we have transferred knowledge to EH staff, artists and food interpreters, members of the community local to Stonehenge, and the Guerialla Archaeology team who will be well placed to continue the dissemination activities leaving a legacy to this project. We also will have created a series of online schools resources that will be freely available and preserved for the foreseeable future and which can be easily expanded or used as template by other cultural heritage agencies.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "The beneficiaries of the project will be:\n\n1. Communities local to Stonehenge - a series of workshops and consultations with community groups will inform the design for activities at the Stonehenge Visitor Centre. Involving local people in heritage themed arts, culture and science initiatives, tailoring learning experiences to community groups interests, and providing training for delivering outreach will develop new life opportunities, create novel links to the past communities of Stonehenge and provide tangible social benefits.\n\n2. Visitors to Stonehenge - the delivery of workshops will enhance and extend the significance of an exhibition focusing on prehistoric food and archaeological science for the estimated 1.6M annual visitors to Stonehenge, many of whom are adult international visitors.\n\n3. Attendees at National Music and Arts Festivals - through collaboration with Guerilla Archaeology, thousands of people at three festival events will be engaged with archaeological research. Festival audiences have a different demographic composition to the traditional visitors to Stonehenge, i.e. young adults. Embedding science within arts and culture outreach at festivals will increase young people's engagement with informal science learning outside traditional educational environments.\n\n4. Science teachers and students - educational audiences will benefit from three online resource packages (Key Stages 2,5,6) tailored to the National Science curriculum. Hosted on the STEM website these resources will be freely available to learning groups nationally. \n\n5. Practitioners - working with archaeologists and EH will embed research within the practice of Artists and Food Interpreters, stimulating new ideas and provide the opportunity to reach entirely new audiences. \n\n6. Public sector agencies - English Heritage benefit from training and knowledge exchange to develop and enhance the skills and the commitment of staff and volunteers, the provision of materials to attract new audiences, design and delivery of workshops to augment on-site visitor experiences and engagement at the Stonehenge Visitor Centre. They will also commercially benefit from the development of new audiences, additional memberships and increase spend at Stonehenge. English Heritage and other Heritage organisations will benefit from the development of new models for disseminating research associated with scheduled monuments which will generate new audiences both at and away from sites across the nation. The project will benefit STEM Learning (the largest provider of STEM education and careers support to young people in the UK) by providing educational resources. The project will enhance and strengthen co-production partnerships through the active engagement of new collaborations (e.g. EH, STEML and festivals), and the consolidation and development of established institutional partnerships.\n\n7. Art and cultural event businesses. will benefit from enhanced audience experience from the outreach and engagement events we propose. \n\n8. Outreach Groups - knowledge exchange, skill and expertise will be developed within GA team members. These individuals often comprise of students and community members from across the UK; co-creating and delivering outreach and engagement events provide them with a range of life and career skills\n\n9. An Early Career Researcher - will be provided with training and opportunities to acquire the skills and expertise needed to maximise the impact of their own research, and develop professional networks.", "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF", "text": "Archaeology", "percentage": 0}]}, "researchTopics": {"researchTopic": [{"id": "14AE809A-4116-46B5-ABF7-DF8BCE2BF069", "text": "Prehistoric Archaeology", "percentage": 0}, {"id": "59A2A0A2-345A-4E14-85F6-936CA1B268C4", "text": "Science-Based Archaeology", "percentage": 0}]}, "rcukProgrammes": {"rcukProgramme": []}, "start": null, "end": null, "participantValues": null}, {"links": {"link": [{"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/AF39BB63-1EA5-4C46-83E2-304C711062D1", "rel": "PI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/5E2B04DD-4A03-45ED-9892-61C5CCB8AC68", "rel": "LEAD_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/funds/B6D68949-5349-4CD5-9F24-866BCB86F606", "rel": "FUND", "start": 1304204400000, "end": 1311980400000, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/keyfindings/60171165-4A0C-4A11-99FB-7A17AEF5EDB6", "rel": "KEY_FINDING", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/disseminations/3B6BE29D-CE2E-4ED4-B41A-089EB7AF86A9", "rel": "DISSEMINATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/disseminations/9F9D949B-1538-4963-9D3F-629D4A627671", "rel": "DISSEMINATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/disseminations/70E9B1D2-0684-4EF7-83BD-1A89B9B3BD57", "rel": "DISSEMINATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/disseminations/329C680F-B8FE-4255-8F60-5742CCBA8C13", "rel": "DISSEMINATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/disseminations/ED75A7C7-8954-4BCC-8C0A-DE9575DC0336", "rel": "DISSEMINATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/disseminations/80F3B8FD-CC2C-4B4F-AB99-1A58D109DA4D", "rel": "DISSEMINATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/disseminations/6FAFBFDD-582E-43FA-A0B2-EE70AE47901D", "rel": "DISSEMINATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/impactsummaries/D6F26503-CC2F-403F-BE29-7FDC6B040166", "rel": "IMPACT_SUMMARY", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/policyinfluences/9425DC26-E53F-4DA1-B8AD-AC0FEA6BB3F5", "rel": "POLICY", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/artisticandcreativeproducts/79C2FB65-EAB3-41D1-AD6F-1703CB6BFE14", "rel": "ARTISTIC_AND_CREATIVE_PRODUCT", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/04695181-6761-4069-8E5A-962CBAEE265E", "rel": "PUBLICATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/C1AB9D39-2C02-4FEB-BC50-5E910226BC6C", "rel": "PUBLICATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/13F425BF-2992-482B-8E39-4AD43720D377", "rel": "PUBLICATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}]}, "ext": null, "id": "684ABC78-FB58-4525-A665-2897617BC84A", "outcomeid": null, "href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/projects/684ABC78-FB58-4525-A665-2897617BC84A", "created": 1582643293000, "updated": null, "identifiers": {"identifier": [{"value": "AH/I015000/1", "type": "RCUK"}]}, "title": "The End of Empire: The northern frontier in the fourth-fifth centuries AD", "status": "Closed", "grantCategory": "Fellowship", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Sch of History, Classics and Archaeology", "abstractText": "The 'End of Empire' project provides a comprehensive interpretation of the late Roman frontier of northern Britain. My doctoral research investigated and analysed the military archaeology in the late frontier, whilst my recent work has extended study into other aspects of frontier life, examining rural, urban, and 'barbarian' archaeology, and challenging the conventional chronological boundary of the Early Medieval period. My current work also focuses on the analysis of artefact assemblages, particularly noting where interpretations of specific classes of artefacts support or contradict hypotheses reached through the interpretation of structural sequences from archaeological excavation. \\n\\nMy investigation of the fourth-century frontier troops or limitanei of northern Britain concluded that the frontier army became increasingly localised over the course of the fourth century, with decreasing links to central imperial authorities. I explained this with reference to the sociological theory of occupational communities, providing a theoretical understanding for changes in the material culture. My doctoral research was limited to the military, analysing and reassessing the structural archaeology through excavation reports and archives from throughout the frontier. My most recent research (which will be finalised during my tenure of this fellowship) considers the changes in the material culture of rural, urban and 'barbarian' communities (to the extent that this latter can be distinguished from other frontier communities), and the links between these groups and the frontier soldiers. The project also includes a critical re-assessment of the contribution of historical sources, including the late-Roman military records known as the Notitia Dignitatum, to the study of the late frontier and the limitanei. This combines the insights of both archaeological and historical research to offer a synthetic treatment of the region.\\n\\nThe majority of this research has been conducted since the completion of my doctoral thesis, including data gathering and analysis. This fellowship will provide the time required to complete the preparation of a manuscript for the publication of the project monograph. I have agreed and signed a contract for the publication of this book with Routledge.\\n\\nThe project will also employ an archaeological illustrator to create interpretive reconstructions of the often ephemeral archaeology of the late fourth and fifth centuries. These illustrations are to be commissioned specifically to highlight the distinctive archaeological footprint of late frontier remains as well as to demonstrate alternative interpretations of structural remains. The illustrations will be employed as another analytical method, as well as to enhance the final publication for broad dissemination.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "There are a number of beneficiary audiences outside the academic community, with impact achieved through publication and dissemination of project results. \\n\\nAt the broadest level, the production of a project monograph with Routledge provides an excellent distribution to a global market. Therefore, there is excellent potential to promote the archaeological resource and research of Britain internationally. \\n\\nThe northern Roman frontier, monumentally represented by Hadrian's Wall, has broad popular appeal in printed and visual media, as well as a favoured tourist destination. As such, it is expected that the book will sell to a wider audience than the academic community. The publication of the project will contribute to continued public interest in the topic, particularly promoting consideration of the late Roman remains, which are generally given less attention in contrast to the archaeology of the second century. Related to this, the commissioning of original artwork to illustrate and interpret late Roman remains will further assist non-academics visualise a different period of British history. \\n\\nThe promotion of Hadrian's Wall and the northern frontier, as an academic interest and tourist destination, corresponds with the goals or numerous regional development agencies, for example Hadrian's Wall Heritage Ltd. Heritage tourism, and resources and outputs that promote this tourism, help to build and develop local economies and infrastructure, as well as 'adding value' to heritage resources. \\n\\nThe project also provides a focus and synthesises data from past excavations and on-going excavations in a fashion that is impossible for archaeological trusts and community projects to achieve, but which further contextualises their work. The dissemination of results from the numerous excavations that contribute to the End of Empire project promotes and develops networks throughout the study area. \\n\\nProject results may have an impact in terms of curation and management of Scheduled Ancient Monuments and World Heritage Sites. The publication will enhance site and monument interpretation, even in cases where research is well documented, for example Hadrian's Wall.

"status": "Closed", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Institute of Archaeology", "abstractText": "One of the most significant technological achievements in human history is the transformation of matter, most spectacularly the invention of metallurgy. This triggered a whole new era of fundamental economic, social and cultural changes. Recent excavations by the core members of this project at Belovode in Serbia revealed copper smelting dated to c. 5000 BC, making it the earliest record of fully-developed metallurgical activity anywhere in the world (Radivojevic et al. 2010). How and why this earliest metallurgy emerged and developed in the Balkans, apparently independently from the Near East, is at the centre of this research project. \\n\\nThe origins of metallurgy have so far been studied mostly in isolation and detached from their technological, social and environmental context. What is now required is a systematic and interdisciplinary approach using sites and assemblages of a sufficiently high archaeological and archaeometallurgical resolution to trace these developments in their mutual relationships. Our recent research at Belovode has revealed the huge potential to do this, and our project now seeks to realise this potential at Belovode and other similar Vinca culture sites. Due to the political situation, little internationally-connected research relevant for this has been done in Serbia since the 1990's; our international team comprises established and emerging scholars on early Balkan metallurgy in an attempt to overcome this hiatus. This UK-Serbian joint venture, together with prominent German colleagues, is a collaboration also designed to exchange knowledge and skills as well as build lasting relationships for the future. \\n\\nThe project combines targeted excavations and surveys at three copper mining, production and consumption sites in Serbia with intensive scientific analysis of finds at laboratories in Britain and Germany. The excavations focus on known metal workshops in two sites, and a prospective third site associated with prehistoric mines. We expect to retrieve copper minerals such as malachite, artefacts such as malachite and metal beads, and metallurgical waste from well-stratified settlement contexts, enabling us to understand the relationship between the earlier craft of bead making and the emergence and new role of metallurgy within the individual settlements, and the wider Vinca Culture. The laboratory-based study of the remains will allow us to reconstruct technical aspects of the metal production, and how it related to malachite used for bead making and the earlier introduction of pottery production as possible pre-cursors to a fully-developed metallurgy. The study of trace elements and isotope ratios of copper minerals and metal artefacts will facilitate the reconstruction of trade in ore and metal, and their consumption, revealing the multiple layers of interaction between the different settlements of the Vinca Culture, often along major river routes (Danube, Sava etc.). Through a combination of these different approaches to archaeometallurgy, combining fieldwork, technological reconstruction, and theoretical considerations of cultural development, the project looks afresh at the technological, social and environmental context in which metal first appeared and was subsequently shaped, distributed and used across the Balkans. \\n\\nOne major discussion concerning the beginning of metallurgy often centres on the question whether metal smelting was only invented once, probably in western Asia, and then spread across Eurasia, or whether there are several independent instances of this invention happening. Our team comprises exponents of both schools of thought, ensuring a balanced approach in our research, and the subsequent interpretations.\\n", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "Who might benefit from the research?\\n\\n- Government officials, and more widely, people interested in improving diplomatic relations between UK and Serbia\\n- Serbian local communities and tourist organisations\\n- Museums and heritage bodies in UK and Serbia\\n- Archaeologists and the wider public in Serbia, UK, and Worldwide who are interested in this important episode in human history \\n- Staff working and related to the project\\n\\nHow will they benefit?\\n\\nThe research will benefit cultural and political sectors of society in the UK, Serbia, and globally. At the broadest level, the project stands as an example of how cultural and intellectual interaction between academics in UK and Serbia vanguards good diplomatic relations between two countries. UK academics working in Serbia are benefiting from interaction with Serbian colleagues and governmental institutions, which serve in improving UK-Serbian relations, thus for the benefit of the governments and people of both countries. \\nThe UK institutions will benefit through operating in international context and influencing the international research agenda, which in turn raises their competitiveness on the global level.\\nThis project engages actively with local communities near archaeological sites by enhancing their knowledge about the neighbouring cultural heritage and help raising awareness of their protection and care. It will also build positive attitudes towards UK organisations, which is particularly important as local Serbian communities usually have little contact with international institutions. In addition, the project will involve local labour and thus improve these relations and communication further. The project will also improve existing tourist experience in the cultural heritage sector and aid local development.\\nThe Serbian National Museum in Belgrade and local museums near Belovode, Plocnik and Jarmovac will prosper from the input of new material and interpretation to enrich their current exhibitions, while the British Museum will gain though exchanging skills and knowledge, as well as planning future collaborative loans, projects and exhibitions. The project aims to provide a platform to raise the profile of Serbian cultural heritage in wider communities in both Serbia and UK, and beyond. The media outreach will provide the fastest flow of information to Serbian, UK and global communities. The exploitation of results through media campaigns will secure instant return to both countries, particularly promoting UK as the world's centre for innovative research.\\nAll staff working on the project, from the UK and Serbia (including also Germany), will benefit from involvement in a collaborative engagement, in terms of advancing their knowledge and experience, as well as the development of specific and generic skills which will improve their future career prospects, within archaeology and beyond. It will also help maintain professional networks extending beyond their own research community. Junior researchers from these countries will be prepared to work in a global research environment.\\nThe wider audience will benefit from a significant increase in the knowledge concerning the emergence of metallurgy as the new, advanced technology in the human history, and a major episode in human history. \\n\\nWhat will be done to ensure that they benefit?\\n\\nIn order to maximise opportunities for the public outreach, PI and Co-I will prioritise social and economic impact in the regular management agenda, and ensure that meetings of the Project Committee advance the project outreach throughout its duration.\\nGovernment officials and diplomats interested in strengthening UK-Serbian relations will be engaged through invitations to public lectures, workshops, conferences, media appearances and exhibitions arising from the project.

Investigating time-lines in teeth with computed tomography and oxygen isotopes.", "status": "Closed", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "NERC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Sch of Life Sciences", "abstractText": "A human tooth crown holds a mini-archive of information recording the diet, climate and residence of its owner. This information allows us to reconstruct what an individual was eating, and what the environmental conditions were in the past. In particular, if we can construct a temporal sequence for an individual we can also determine how they moved around and utilized this environment, and what seasonal changes in temperature were experienced. We know this can be done from the enamel of the molar teeth of cattle and sheep where there is a relatively straightforward 'time-line' spanning one or more years from the top of the tooth towards the root. These estimates for tooth crown development have been confirmed by recent isotopic studies that demonstrate seasonally distinct signatures rather than an averaged value. Human teeth, however, are very different in how they form and in their final, bulbous shape. Although the sequence of human tooth formation and eruption is well established, the pattern of enamel mineralization is very poorly understood. An initial organic scaffold of enamel is laid down over regular time periods producing a visible laminated structure (Lines of Retzius). The mineralization process, in which enamel forms within and eventually replaces the organic framework, is extremely complex and may progress spatially in several directions at once. Thus human enamel does not closely follow the 'time-line' of organic deposition, or at least, not in a straightforward chronological manner. It has been proposed that enamel mineralizes from the biting edge down, from the inside out, from the outside in, along the lines of organic matrix deposition and that thin enamel mineralizes before thick. We need to know the length of time that mineralization takes to complete, whether enamel simply records an averaged value for the whole period throughout its depth and across its surface, and if, where, and in what direction, the passage of time is recorded. Understanding this pattern is essential if we are to extract time-series information from human tooth crowns, and to interpret this data rigorously. The problem has been impossible to address in living children without repeated X-ray or large-scale extraction of developing teeth. Since these are ethically unacceptable, pigs have been used as the closest human proxies. A new approach has been identified. Archaeological skeletal collections contain many children who died whilst their teeth were still developing. The processes of tooth mineralization can be investigated using computed tomography (CT), even for teeth encased within the jaw. The method is non-destructive, repeatable and highly sensitive to differences in tissue density. A pilot study showed that fully mineralized enamel can be differentiated from incompletely mineralized enamel within a single tooth, and the difference quantified and viewed in 3D. This study will obtain multi-slice, CT scans from developing tooth crowns (incisors, canines, premolars and molars). In total, 408 teeth from over 100 juvenile skeletons curated at the University of Bradford will be scanned to investigate progressive stages of mineralization in each of the 10 selected tooth categories. Using specialized MIMICS software, 3D coloured images and animations will be produced to track the advancing front of mineralizing enamel. Where potential 'time-lines' are identified, we will test them in fully developed modern and ancient teeth using a laser to sample along the length of the line. If the passage of time is recorded in the enamel, the oxygen isotope ratios along the line should vary in a regular manner because they are sensitive to changes in climate, particularly temperature differences between summer and winter. However, if they do not vary or if variation is random, irregular and not reproducible between teeth developing at the same time in a single individual, short-term seasonality may not be preserved in human enamel.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": null, "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF", "text": "Archaeology", "percentage": 50}, {"id": "6E910789-6B8D-4B73-B5B0-F3156942B558", "text": "Geosciences", "percentage": 50}]}, "researchTopics": {"researchTopic": [{"id": "7DCAF586-72E2-4881-9251-E72F38AF1CA4", "text": "Palaeoenvironments", "percentage": 50}, {"id": "59A2A0A2-345A-4E14-85F6-936CA1B268C4", "text": "Science-Based Archaeology", "percentage": 50}]}, "rcukProgrammes": {"rcukProgramme": []}, "start": null, "end": null, "participantValues": null}, {"links": {"link": [{"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/44D22548-7A50-4D06-AE6C-A931D144E940", "rel": "PI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/485D6E7C-0BD6-4038-BDDD-DC967500606E", "rel": "COI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/3EAE04CA-9D62-4483-B9C4-F91AD9F4C5A9", "rel": "LEAD_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/funds/2F1C1E01-CA8C-4B64-9BA7-1B74BE170A4D", "rel": "FUND", "start": 1180652400000, "end": 1243724400000, "otherAttributes": {}}]}, "ext": null, "id": "5A11A403-A6BF-43DB-A1AC-7BE9123BCD46", "outcomeid": null, "href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/projects/5A11A403-A6BF-43DB-A1AC-7BE9123BCD46", "created": 1582643293000, "updated": null, "identifiers": {"identifier": [{"value": "AH/E002412/1", "type": "RCUK"}]}, "title": "Measuring the isotopic landscape: bone chemistry, the environment, and ancient agriculture in the Thames Valley", "status": "Closed", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Archaeology and History of Art Res Lab", "abstractText": "Summary\\nThis proposal is to develop deeper, more detailed, ways to learn about farming in Southern England and how it changed from Neolithic to Roman times. We have chosen a well researched region with detailed archaeological knowledge and, for many sites, a good record of the environmental context. We propose to analyse chemically the bones from a statistically robust number of domesticated animals from 32 well studied sites. We will measure 'stable isotopes', that is atoms of the actual animals' food, which remain in their bones. We know that slight variations in stable isotopes are due to changes in diet, which can come about from changes in management, or changes in food-plant isotopes. Plant isotopes cannot be measured directly, but do depend on subtle changes in their environment. Actually, although we have an understanding of several types of environmental influence, we do not know clearly and exactly how the environment is reflected in animal bone isotope values; but we do know that animal bone isotopes from various sites show intriguing patterns of variation and correlation, in a site over time, or between species, or between sites in different settings. This research is to characterise what sorts of pattern occur in settings where we can relate the results to known environments, and then to use it to extend our knowledge of these sites. This combination of chemical isotopy and environmental information has not been made before, perhaps because it requires to be at a large scale to be successful, and relies on a lot of experience of both isotopic and environmental methodologies.\\nThe kind of information we hope to learn includes the following:- when and why did pig husbandry change, and were they then fed more household scraps, milk whey, or just rooted about nearer human refuse pits ? Is there any sign that soils became progressively depleted in nitrogen, and can a manuring signal be detected ? Do cattle (particularly) show evidence that their management moved from a more wooded to a more open environment ? Where increased flooding occurs in the valley floodplains, does this have a recognisable effect on plant and bone isotopes (as suspected) ? Is a change in the nitrogen isotope we have seen on one site we studied really due to the cultivation of hay and therefore an increase in leguminous species (which have lower nitrogen isotope ratio values) in the sward ?\\nFurthermore, we hope that by getting much more focussed results than anyone has so far, we will see new patterns in the isotopic compositions that will lead to new thoughts about what can be learnt from isotopes. This also important for understanding how the bones of humans, who eat the animals, acquire their isotopic composition, and therefore for understanding how to reconstruct ancient human diet.\\n", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": null, "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF", "text": "Archaeology", "percentage": 0}]}, "researchTopics": {"researchTopic": [{"id": "59A2A0A2-345A-4E14-85F6-936CA1B268C4", "text": "Science-Based Archaeology", "percentage": 0}]}, "rcukProgrammes": {"rcukProgramme": []}, "start": null, "end": null, "participantValues": null}, {"links": {"link": [{"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/BFDA9028-7704-42E5-972E-AC6C9426A001", "rel": "PI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/A037C26F-2172-4927-91DA-921F67B7EF39", "rel": "LEAD_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/funds/DC72FA70-4031-4D45-A8B7-94FD13AC099B", "rel": "FUND", "start": 1209596400000, "end": 1246316400000, "otherAttributes": {}}]}, "ext": null, "id": "4DE359F8-1F89-4FF6-A5FD-61B5C4B29B93", "outcomeid": null, "href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/projects/4DE359F8-1F89-4FF6-A5FD-61B5C4B29B93", "created": 1582643293000, "updated": null, "identifiers": {"identifier": [{"value": "AH/F01743X/1", "type": "RCUK"}]}, "title": "Normative Divisions and New Exclusions: Aesthetic Territorialism in Contemporary Art", "status": "Closed", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Wimbledon College of Art", "abstractText": "This project seeks to produce a new single channel video artwork that explores how the ordering and regulation of communal space in contemporary western democracy is connected to a liberalist poltics of individuation. Through examining the historical conditions of philosophical theory, cultural literature and the architecture of social space that have priveleged 'a culture of critique', or 'a culture of difference', as a means to resist or comment on the problems of institutional power, the work aims to raise questions regarding if and how this politics of culture aids and abets structures of authority, or if it makes them less stable now.

The social and cultural geography of Los Angeles is the example, par excellence of how the liberalist principle of individuality orders social systems, evidenced in the boundary demarcation of social space and gated communities. Conducting research in Los Angeles I aim to examine the architecture and theory of a historic 'exile modernism', a term attributed to the post-war German community of writers and philosophers including Thomas Mann, Bertolt Brecht and Theodor Adorno who settled in Los Angeles in the 1940's. I seek to test to what extent their philosophy of resistance and withdrawal from the culture of Los Angeles is coterminous with a politics of security and protection seen in Los Angeles planning, architecture and social housing today. \\n\\nThe research will involve a 10 day exploratory visit to Los Angeles to conduct theoretical research and practical preparatory work including:\\na) Researching, visiting and documenting the architecture from and associated with 'exile modernism' / the houses of Brecht, Thomas Mann and Theodor Adorno\\nb) Confirm times and venues for future filming\\nc) Work on location and to arrange preparatory shots, lighting of interior/exteriors and day/night work and the developments of the style of the video.\\nd) Study historical documentation and aesthetic representations of Los Angeles architecture by working with the Julius Shulman archive at the Getty Institute, Los Angeles\\ne) Confirm technical equipment available in Los Angeles for the shoot\\ne) Meet with researchers and gallerists to discuss the project\\n\\nAfter this visit I will spend time developing the work in the UK and prepare for a return trip to Los Angeles to film the piece, following which the work will be edited, scored and completed.\\n\\nCentral to this research is a questioning of how art participates in reconfiguring what is understood to be our 'commonality', how this squares with our conception of a critical art practice and how (and if) art is capable of producing new agreements that transform and dissent from those that are considered to be established and institutional. This project seeks to examine the possibilities for these claims, whilst recognising that they hold within them a problematic idealization of arts' political power. In order to do this, my research makes connections between the culture of difference as a norm through the work of exile modernists, how it is present now, within the artworld, and how it is also evidenced in this culture of boundaried communal space. Together they share the problem of creating private pseudo-democracies that limit their potential to reconfiguring what politics is and means to us. \\n\\nThis research project seeks to explore how these private territories produce ideological narratives and how these mythologies are literally manifest in literature, social space and art objects within the public domain. In producing new work on this theme I ask if, and how, images of community seen in art, philosophy and social space are capable of establishing new territories in the political field.",

Star Carr", "status": "Closed", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "NERC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Archaeology", "abstractText": "Star Carr is an Early Mesolithic, hunter-gatherer site near Scarborough, North Yorkshire which dates to the 9th millennium cal. BC. The site has become internationally renowned due to the richness of the organic artefacts and ecofacts deposited on the edge of a lake and consequently preserved within peat for roughly 11,000 years. The importance of the site has recently been recognised by English Heritage, who are about to schedule the site as a National Monument. Star Carr was first discovered and excavated by local archaeologist John Moore in 1948, followed by three further seasons of excavation carried out by Grahame Clark of the University of Cambridge. The site produced 191 harpoons, 21 antler headdresses, elk antler mattocks, bone scrapers, awls and bodkins, a wooden paddle, amber and shale beads, as well as a large assemblage of faunal remains. In the 1980s further work was carried out revealing a timber platform or trackway, constructed of hewn planks, which is the earliest evidence of systematic carpentry in Europe. More recent excavations since 2004 have produced further important discoveries which rewrite our understanding of this period: another timber platform/trackway was discovered, evidence for the earliest hut structure in Britain was found and the size of the site and longevity of occupation suggests that people were settling into this landscape, as opposed to being highly mobile. However, there is a major problem: during recent excavations it has been discovered that the organic remains which made the site so important are severely deteriorating. The key findings are that: 1) In the waterlogged trench located next to Clark's trench (where abundant quantities of bone and antler were found in 1954) only 2 pieces of severely deteriorated bone were found, one of these being a 'jelly-bone', i.e. completely de-mineralised and mainly composed of gelatin; 2) All of the 25 fragments of antler found in the two recently excavated waterlogged trenches were extremely flattened and had become leathery; 3) Both the wood and the peat were extremely compressed and the wood has little to no cellulose surviving 4) The deposits in this field are highly acidic (&lt; pH 3.0) and vulnerable to further increases in acidity and oxidisation. Wood of this period and in this abundance is unique to this site in the UK, and so far has provided tantalizing glimpses on early methods of wood-working, including hewing and splitting into planks. However, little is known about the platforms, glimpsed in two 2m wide trenches 25m apart: are these parts of one large platform? What was it used for? Is it a trackway running into the lake? How long was it used for? How does it relate to the artefacts deposited around it? How was it constructed? An understanding of these issues will not only answer important questions for hunter-gatherer archaeology in Europe, but will also contribute to key debates in later prehistory on the function of similar platforms and trackways and the use of wetlands in prehistory. Research demonstrates that the wood is no longer constantly waterlogged. Data from the MET office shows that rainfall totals across the UK have been lowest for over 40 years for the first five months of 2010. Such a lowering of the water table is predicted to have further disastrous consequences: i.e. conditions may have become optimal for aerobic decay and the wood will be rapidly digested by aerobic bacteria and fungi. The team believes that the now precariously fragile worked wood will not be amenable to further analysis beyond this year. Therefore, this research proposal aims to excavate areas of the timber platform before it is too late.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": null, "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF", "text": "Archaeology", "percentage": 100}]}, "researchTopics": {"researchTopic": [{"id": "59A2A0A2-345A-4E14-85F6-936CA1B268C4", "text": "Science-Based Archaeology", "percentage": 100}]}, "rcukProgrammes": {"rcukProgramme": []}, "start": null, "end": null, "participantValues": null}, {"links": {"link": [{"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/C46A1788-EAAE-4542-99DB-8F66AE1DDE03", "rel": "PI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/C04EA393-5137-4DC1-850C-4C2BD8251E91", "rel": "COI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/CB9334C2-A4D2-46A1-AE51-6EB3E01B15C6", "rel": "COI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/961756BF-E31F-4A13-836F-0A09BA02385C", "rel": "LEAD_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/F30AE9C7-8E9D-482D-8FFA-2114A497D7EC", "rel": "COLLAB_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/funds/0625621C-97A9-4EE1-A900-FB75568D0354", "rel": "FUND", "start": 1230768000000, "end": 1293753600000, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/keyfindings/22B83614-0A80-4761-B18E-40397DA083CE", "rel": "KEY_FINDING", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/collaborations/5A788C63-7D66-4BCA-9925-18E04DE4C001", "rel": "COLLABORATION", "start": 1388534400000, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/disseminations/41D14264-6C3A-4736-9AA4-9F9814BA08FD", "rel": "DISSEMINATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/furtherfundings/BB5F5A18-6DBC-4EE4-9593-8C53B2E2E49C", "rel": "FURTHER_FUNDING", "start": 1306882800000, "end": 1338591600000, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/furtherfundings/5A85938D-5284-4269-84A7-4FE8C4D65891", "rel": "FURTHER_FUNDING", "start": 1359676800000, "end": 1385942400000, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/impactsummaries/C926B058-83E8-4CCE-A8F3-E94201E6B240", "rel": "IMPACT_SUMMARY", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/artisticandcreativeproducts/87E6F8F2-0082-42F5-A541-F1986A789FED", "rel": "ARTISTIC_AND_CREATIVE_PRODUCT", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/artisticandcreativeproducts/32FF9A25-5431-46CE-8426-20C4F9B5E8B6", "rel": "ARTISTIC_AND_CREATIVE_PRODUCT", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/42508E70-7441-42D2-B50A-E1D9733C4AE1", "rel": "PUBLICATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}]}, "ext": null, "id": "50652E48-87B5-477E-8078-7240B61B5317", "outcomeid": null, "href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/projects/50652E48-87B5-477E-8078-7240B61B5317", "created": 1582643293000, "updated": null, "identifiers": {"identifier": [{"value": "AH/G015341/1", "type": "RCUK"}]}, "title": "Touching the Untouchable: Increasing Access to Archaeological Artefacts by Virtual Handling", "status": "Closed", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Archaeology", "abstractText": "Computer interfaces that provide information to the sense of touch offer exciting possibilities for interactive museum displays in which the visitor can handle virtual replicas of museum objects.

The focus of the proposed research cluster is this virtual handling of museum objects, with archaeological textiles selected as a case study. New touch technologies offer the chance to handle virtual replicas of these rare and fragile objects. In addition, such a computer system is far more portable than a large collection of real objects and so offers significant outreach potential for public groups unable to visit the museum.\\n \\nOn seeing a textile it is natural to wish to handle it - the characteristic mechanical and surface properties of textiles are best understood by manipulation.

"grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Sch of Computing", "abstractText": "This project will increase the knowledge about, and build transferable expertise in, the remote sensing (RS) of archaeological residues (AR). Current archaeological RS techniques have evolved with variable understanding of the physical, chemical, biological and environmental processes involved. Thus current detection strategies do not allow systematic AR assessment leading to sub-optimal heritage management and development control. This project will focus on analysing the physical and environmental factors that influence AR contrast dynamics with the overall aim of improving site and feature detection.\\n\\nArchaeological RS techniques rely on the ability of a sensor to detect the contrast between an AR and its immediate surroundings or matrix. AR detection is influenced by many factors - changes in precipitation, temperature, crop stress/type, soil type and structure and land management techniques. These factors vary seasonally and diurnally, meaning that the ability to detect an AR with a specific sensor changes over time.\\n\\nWithout understanding the processes that affect the visibility and detection of ARs (directly and by proxy), prospection techniques will remain somewhat ad-hoc and opportunistic. Enhanced knowledge of ARs is important in the long-term curation of a diminishing heritage and will provide cost savings to operational works (through more effective mitigation). This is important in environments where traditional optical aerial photography has been unresponsive (e.g pasture and clay soils).\\n\\nThe project is timely considering the recent development of high spatial and spectral resolution ground, air and satellite sensors.\\nThe project involves 4 stages:\\n1 Identifying appropriate candidate sites and sampling methodology\\n2 Field measurements and collecting and analysing field samples from sites under different conditions\\n3 Physical modelling, feedback, knowledge articulation\\n4 Evaluation\\nSites will be chosen on the basis of contrasting ARs, soil and land management conditions etc. Close liaison with curatorial agencies (with excavation data) is necessary to ensure a representative range of AR types is identified. It will be important to include sites with varying environmental conditions and AR types (buried soils, 'negative' features such as ditches, buried masonry and surface materials).\\n\\nTo determine contrast factors strategic samples and measurements will be taken on and around the AR at different times of the day and year to ensure that a representative range of conditions is covered. Field measurements will include geophysical and hyperspectral surveys, thermal profiling, soil moisture and spectral reflectance. Laboratory analysis of samples will include geochemistry and particle size.\\n\\nModels will be developed that translate these physical values into spectral, magnetic, electrical and acoustic measures in order to determine contrast parameters. Data fusion and knowledge reasoning techniques will be used to develop management tools to improve the programming of surveys. These tools will be used to deploy sensors, including aerial hyperspectral devices, for evaluation purposes.\\n\\nIn summary, this project will impact on and develop:\\n1 Baseline understanding and knowledge about AR contrast processes and preservation dynamics:\\n a. leading to better management and curation\\n b. providing data to model environmental impact on ARs\\n c. enhancing the understanding of the resource base\\n2 The identification of suitable sensors and conditions for their use (and feedback to improve sensor design)\\n3 Data fusion techniques (physical models, multi-sensor data and domain knowledge) to improve AR identification\\n4 An Interdisciplinary network between remote sensing, soil science, computing and heritage professionals\\n5 Techniques for researchers to access data archives more effectively\\n\\nWe believe that the results will have national impact and have the potential for transfer throughout the world.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "DART will impact on the primary, secondary and tertiary consumers defined in the Academic Beneficiaries section.\\n\\nTwo workshops are opportunities to engage with all user groups. In addition to describing progress and developments, the workshops will capture how different end-users envisage engaging with the resources. This will provide insights into any capacity building issues, which in turn influences the design of project outputs. Participants from the tertiary sector will be actively sought through involvement with a range of heritage and industry organisations.\\n\\nEDUCATION IMPACT\\nEducation resources will be developed so that the research can be incorporated into education and learning programmes. The Aerial Archaeology Research Group (AARG) 'Education in Aerial Remote Sensing for Archaeology' will be used as a template for the delivery of open licence exemplar teaching material. Digital material, deposited online (e.g. YouTube, slideshare), will be developed to address capacity building and training issues. These resources will be disseminated to heritage curators at a number of regional/national seminars\\n\\nPOLICY IMPACT\\nMore knowledge will be gained about the nature and range of archaeological residues leading to better preservation and management strategies. These will have further impact on other areas of heritage management and its public consumption. The consortium contains many potential beneficiaries and they will disseminate the policy impact through their formal and informal networks.\\n\\nINTERNATIONAL IMPACT\\nAlthough the UK has a high quality cultural resource management record there are many other countries throughout the world which do not. These countries will use remote sensing techniques to provide the initial foundation of any incipient Cultural Resource Management dataset. It is therefore imperative that they have tools that allow them to develop an effective detection strategy. This research will support a number of further research and management strands within Europe and the rest of the world. DART will develop information packs aimed at National Heritage and other international organisations (e.g. UNESCO, CIPA, ICOMOS). DART will collaborate with NET-HERITAGE (http://www.netheritage.eu) concerning the creation and dissemination of method and policy material.\\n\\nECONOMIC/INDUSTRY/ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT\\nFrom a practice perspective the proposed framework will facilitate more reliable and robust survey methods leading to increased information about poorly-understood landscapes. It is expected that this will result in a quantitative gain in the number of AR observations (including 'new' observations) and a qualitative gain in the content of the observations. This will have a direct impact on curatorial officers working within development control and the planning process. In addition, heritage consultants will be more aware of the science underpinning remote sensing and the range of conditions under which it is appropriate. This knowledge will have direct impact on development advice and lead to evidence-led mitigation policies. DART will collaborate with National Heritage Organisations, local Councils and the Regional Development Agencies to develop best practice material for these user groups.\\n\\nThe data, models and services made available through DART will provide baseline resources for heritage-focussed studies in environmental change and condition impact. These studies will also have a policy dimension. DART will collaborate with other researchers, national heritage organisations and heritage consultants to raise awareness about the digital resource.\\n", "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []},

research which establishes a methodology for using measurements of the past magnetic field of the Earth for dating archaeological materials in the last 4000 years in the UK. The primary aim of this project is to realise the potential of this research by developing its practical application in UK archaeology.\\n\\nBuilding a chronology is the single most important step in the study of the human past and scientific dating is now fundamental to archaeological investigations. Archaeomagnetic dating has great potential: it dates fired clay and stone, for example hearths, kilns, ovens and furnaces which occur frequently on archaeological sites; it dates the last use of features, providing a clear link to human activity; it is cost-effective and is potentially most precise in periods where other dating methods, such as radiocarbon dating, are problematic. There is increasing interest in using archaeomagnetic dating as part of the suite of chronological tools available to archaeologists. This is demonstrated by the explicit requirement to consider its use in recent best practice guidance produced for the development-led archaeology sector and by its increasing use in excavations conducted by the commercial archaeological sector (it is estimated that 50-100 archaeomagnetic dates per year are currently commissioned).\\n\\nHowever, whilst academic research establishes the scientific basis for the use of the method, it has yet to be adopted routinely. This is partly due to a lack of accessible information allowing evaluation of its suitability in specific archaeological circumstances and partly because there is no coordinated, centralised record of existing archaeomagnetic measurements. This project will address these deficiencies by developing a web-based resource and database which will collate all existing UK archaeomagnetic data and allow the user to address specific questions, such as the expected errors in a particular period, the suitability of specific types of features and the existence of previous studies in the same region or on the same type of feature. Archaeomagnetic dates are produced by comparing measurements of magnetic direction obtained from archaeological materials with a record of geomagnetic field variations built up from archaeomagnetic studies of archaeological features dated by other methods. The proposed project will not only allow users to calibrate magnetic measurements to obtain dates, but it will also allow new data to be incorporated in the geomagnetic field model, thus improving the technique for future use. The latter aspect is particularly important as the technique improves as more data is collected for the calibration record.\\n\\nThe project combines academic research at the University of Bradford with the expertise of English Heritage in developing best practice within the English archaeological sector. The project outcomes will primarily be useful to archaeologists working in both commercial and research settings and to those advising and budgeting for archaeological investigations.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": null, "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF", "text": "Archaeology", "percentage": 0}]}, "researchTopics": {"researchTopic": [{"id": "59A2A0A2-345A-4E14-85F6-936CA1B268C4", "text": "Science-Based Archaeology", "percentage": 0}]}, "rcukProgrammes": {"rcukProgramme": []}, "start": null, "end": null, "participantValues": null}, {"links": {"link": [{"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/B9585634-D1B0-4CF9-AC66-B3D5D25531DC", "rel": "PI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/6582389A-838F-42F4-95CA-F52F5E207768", "rel": "COI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/9124ED7B-5204-496E-914E-A6D7C3EF1D7D", "rel": "COI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/598EFAAF-B387-4C59-8CCC-968F2B950EC4", "rel": "RESEARCH_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/68D0E3C9-9246-4CFC-B5E9-48584CF82993", "rel": "LEAD_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/F5B83740-823A-461B-AEB6-0DCFED1739C8", "rel": "PP_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/funds/513831A7-6164-4CD7-9C5F-E671A4401FA9", "rel": "FUND", "start": 1522537200000, "end": 1632956400000, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/D015B276-0622-47DA-9784-B2C64A932E72", "rel": "PUBLICATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}]}, "ext": null, "id": "D72C09F2-BB4D-4958-849D-CDA49436B69F", "outcomeid": null, "href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/projects/D72C09F2-BB4D-4958-849D-CDA49436B69F", "created": 1582643293000, "updated": null, "identifiers": {"identifier": [{"value": "NE/R011168/1", "type": "RCUK"}]}, "title": "The co-evolution of human hands and tool using behaviour", "status": "Active", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "NERC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Earth Atmospheric and Env Sciences", "abstractText": "When you talk to people about what makes humans different from other animals, one of the features that they will rapidly identify is the human hand. Indeed they are very likely to identify the 'opposable thumb' as a uniquely human characteristic. Whilst it can be argued that this is not strictly true, it is certainly the case that there are no other animals that have anything like the degree of precise control of their hands that humans have. We take for granted the fine movements of individual fingers that allow us to play the piano or tie our shoelaces, and these are activities that are impossible for non-humans to achieve. It is likely that the evolutionary history of our species is very closely linked to the evolutionary history of our hands and this is therefore an important area for scientific study. We currently know a great deal about how the shape of our hands has changed from those of closely related species but we actually know very little about how these shape changes are linked to how the hand functions. The story of our divergence from the common ancestor of chimpanzees and modern humans includes walking on our hindlimbs, the creation of stone tools, the increase in our intelligence, and living in extended social groups. The change in function of the human hand by losing its locomotor role and allowing its specialisation for manipulating and sensing the world, and extending its role in communication becomes a compelling narrative. In particular the idea that the evolution of our hands is closely linked to our adoption of increasingly sophisticated tools seems extremely plausible.\n\nThus the aim of this research project is to explore the changes in functional capabilities of the human hand and to use this information to evaluate the evolutionary history of the hand and its relationship to tool use and manufacture. To achieve this goal we need to collect information about how the individual parts of the hand are used in humans. This needs to be done in a controlled fashion so that we can make objective comparisons of the mechanical requirements of different actions that we can link to specific artifacts in the achaeological record. We therefore propose to collect movement and force information from humans whilst performing such a range of tasks. We will use a range of exciting new technologies developed for virtual reality and movie special effects where hand and finger movements can be recorded automatically using specially instrumented gloves and by attaching reflective markers to the fingers. In addition simply recording this information is insufficient to fully understand a mechanism as complex as a hand. We will also construct 3D computer simulations of these hand and arm movements using information from medical imaging and dissections. We will then use a variety of sophisticated mechanical engineering techniques to evaluate how the individual bones and muscles function within the hand. We also need to evaluate how human hand function has changed over time and this means that we need to investigate the hands of fossil primates as well as their living relatives. To do this we will create equivalent computer simulations for these extinct species reconstructed from the fossil bones. The computer models will allow us to predict the capabilities of these species and we will be able to directly evaluate the changes in locomotor, foraging and tool use capabilities of the hands of our closest ancestors over time.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "This is basic, discovery driven science and so the biggest impact will be cultural in terms of increased knowledge about our place in the evolution of life on the earth. This is a topic that is of great interest to members of the public and we expect the outcomes of this research to be widely reported and generate a great deal of interest. The combination of important fossils in museum collections, charismatic endangered primate species, sophisticated and visual human experimentation as well as cutting edge computer technology adds considerable value and provides opportunities for increased exposure through routes such as science festivals, school visits and museum/university open days.\n\nThere are also a number of specific groups that we will target for greater impact:\n\n1) The industrial community involved in the production of packaging. This will be an ideal opportunity to take advantage of AY's extensive industrial contacts in industry to highlight the latest research into hand function and how hands interact with objects in the wider world.\n\n2) The high performance industrial computing community. WS will use this project as a vehicle to illustrate the wide applicability of HPC computing. There is currently a great deal of interest in alternative platforms such as the Xeon Phi and their extremely impressive HPC on the desktop credentials combined with minimising the energy cost of computation.

"grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Politics, Philosophy & History", "abstractText": "Vivid narratives of youth and adolescence have dominated popular understanding of young people's lives. They have shaped government youth policy, influenced the academic projects of youth researchers and fed the appetites of the media and general public, often at the expense of understanding 'the mundane and humdrum experiences' which are most young people's lot. Historians have found 'good copy' in youth indiscipline, street gangs and delinquency, although these have only ever involved a minority of boys. Popular scrutiny of young people's lives (particularly young men) still focuses on the more outrageous as dramatic stereotypes continue to obscure the essential conformity of the majority. This project represents a response to the need for a different history of youth, one which places the historical experiences of working-class young males in the context of broader gender changes and which challenges dominant stereotypes of male adolescents as either 'youth in trouble' or 'youth as trouble'; one which explores neglected issues of adolescent 'compliance' and conformity and which demonstrates how meanings and representations of adolescent masculinity were/are nuanced in ways which have often been disregarded or under-estimated. The project argues that historical scholarship needs to move beyond one-dimensional analyses which privilege exceptional youth behaviour or particular types of youth conformity based on the archival dominance of the organized youth movement. It contributes to a more nuanced understanding of youthful masculinities, particularly mainstream youth by assessing the quieter, conformist attitudes and behaviours usually absent in examinations of male youth culture. Educationalists and youth workers were at the forefront of concerns about how best to inculcate manliness in a new generation of working-class young men in the interwar years and the research contrasts this rhetorical masculinity with the pragmatic everydayness of boys' own involvement with the activities they encouraged. It suggests how exposure to more relaxed social and emotional codes through the popular press and commercial entertainment subtly influenced young men's sense of self during adolescence and explores how new models of personal behaviour and social interaction influenced the self-image and anxieties of working-class boys and young men, particularly in relation to images of the body during the 1930s, the 'first decade to feel the full impact of mass media on society'. The 'glamour photography' of the popular press signified the growing sexualisation of the female body and the research argues that this has tended to over-shadow its complex implications for young men's bodies and notions of the male physique, as new visual forms helped shape male self-consciousness and sensitivity to body image and fashion. More relaxed social relationships and sexualized leisure spaces such as the dance floor offered young men novel opportunities to perform and be seen yet also introduced new anxieties and uncertainties to the male world of adolescent feeling, which the research explores in relation to individuals and through the advice columns of the popular press. It also examines how everyday activities such as cycling and walking shaped male social identity during adolescence, helping to invest place and locality with particular masculine meanings. An extensive range of qualitative evidence and contemporary surveys are used to explore these issues, including newspapers, magazines, autobiographies, oral histories, letters, Mass-Observation and the records of the boys' club movement. The project's most unusual primary source is my father's diaries, written in his mid teens in 1930s' Northampton, which are carefully contextualised in relation to these broader trends and developments.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": null, "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF", "text": "Archaeology", "percentage": 0}]}, "researchTopics": {"researchTopic": [{"id": "59A2A0A2-345A-4E14-85F6-936CA1B268C4", "text": "Science-Based Archaeology", "percentage": 0}]}, "rcukProgrammes": {"rcukProgramme": []}, "start": null, "end": null, "participantValues": null}]}
