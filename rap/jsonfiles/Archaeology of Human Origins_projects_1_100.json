Mountains, southern Arabia", "status": "Closed", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "History and Cultures", "abstractText": "Arabia is situated at the nexus of three continents, connecting Africa, Asia, and Europe. Given this geographic position, the territory of southern Arabia may have served as an important pathway linking hominins throughout the Pleistocene. Indeed, many of our species' most diverse and ancient mitochondrial (mtDNA) and Y-chromosome (yDNA) genetic lineages cluster around the Arabian Peninsula, confirming that the subcontinent played a critical role in the evolution and expansion of modern humans. Some scholars have even documented traces of a human expansion back into Africa, suggesting that this pathway was a bidirectional conduit of population movement. It is not surprising that the peninsula facilitated periodic population expansions. The drastically oscillating Upper Pleistocene palaeoclimate occasionally transformed Arabia's hyperarid desert interior into savannah grasslands incised by perennial rivers and playa lakes. The landscape was also dramatically altered by depressed sea levels that exposed the continental shelf along the Red Sea and within the Arabo-Persian Gulf basin, together exposing over one million square kilometres of land. In addition, reduced sea levels triggered increased freshwater upwelling across these emerged landscapes, creating stable refugia for Arabia's prehistoric inhabitants. Given this cyclical process of amelioration and desiccation, it is posited that Arabia served as a demographic pump by drawing in hunter-gatherers during favourable phases; conversely, causing them to contract back into geographically conscripted refugia at the onset of aridification. Challenging climatic conditions created a negative-feedback-loop, as environmental desiccation reduced landscape carrying capacity and exerted pressure on Arabian foragers. This research project will investigate one such environmental refugium: the Dhofar Mountains in southern Oman. Even under the present arid climatic regime, the annual monsoon rains deposit up to 400 mm of rainfall during the summer months. Therefore, Dhofar is posited to have served as an important population retreat during climatic downturns. This is supported by new evidence from al-Hatab Rockshelter in Dhofar, where evidence of human occupation during the Terminal Pleistocene has been found - a hyperarid phase when the peninsula was previously thought to have been uninhabitable. Research in Dhofar permits the exploration of a potentially important refugium to determine the local record of human occupation and what adaptive behaviours (if any) developed amidst the backdrop of a fluctuating palaeoclimate. A series of preliminary investigations conducted by the PI throughout the region have recorded dense and ubiquitous lithic surface scatters across the landscape, often found in association with ancient lake basins and relict drainage systems. Two in situ buried archaeological sites have been tested (al-Hatab rockshelter and Ras A&iuml;n Noor), with several other deposits requiring test-pitting (see Figures 1, 2, and 3 in visual evidence). Weaving together geological landscape survey with archaeological excavation and radiometric dating, we will begin to reconstruct the sequence of Upper Pleistocene occupation in Dhofar to articulate the expansion and contraction of hunter-gatherer communities associated with this niche.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": null, "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []},

Given this cyclical process of amelioration and desiccation, it is posited that Arabia served as a demographic pump by drawing in hunter-gatherers during favourable phases; conversely, causing them to contract back into geographically conscripted refugia at the onset of aridification. Challenging climatic conditions created a negative-feedback-loop, as environmental desiccation reduced landscape carrying capacity and exerted pressure on Arabian foragers.\\n\\nThis research project will investigate one such environmental refugium: the Dhofar Mountains in southern Oman. Even under the present arid climatic regime, the annual monsoon rains deposit up to 400 mm of rainfall during the summer months. Therefore, Dhofar is posited to have served as an important population retreat during climatic downturns. This is supported by new evidence from al-Hatab Rockshelter in Dhofar, where evidence of human occupation during the Terminal Pleistocene has been found - a hyperarid phase when the peninsula was previously thought to have been uninhabitable.\\n\\nResearch in Dhofar permits the exploration of a potentially important refugium to determine the local record of human occupation and what adaptive behaviours (if any) developed amidst the backdrop of a fluctuating palaeoclimate. A series of preliminary investigations conducted by the PI throughout the region have recorded dense and ubiquitous lithic surface scatters across the landscape, often found in association with ancient lake basins and relict drainage systems. Two in situ buried archaeological sites have been tested (al-Hatab rockshelter and Ras A&iuml;n Noor), with several other deposits requiring test-pitting (see Figures 1, 2, and 3 in visual evidence). Weaving together geological landscape survey with archaeological excavation and radiometric dating, we will begin to reconstruct the sequence of Upper Pleistocene occupation in Dhofar to articulate the expansion and contraction of hunter-gatherer communities associated with this niche.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": null, "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []},

We rely on tools to feed and protect ourselves, but they are also deeply embedded in our everyday social lives. Just try living without your mobile phone or internet access, the espresso machine or a knife and fork and you will soon appreciate the social importance of 'things'. For more than two million years we have evolved physically and socially and tools have been an integral part of our becoming human. Even though archaeologists know a lot about how tools were made, we understand little about how and why changes in technology happened. Trial and error and necessity might be all we need to consider, plus that rare eureka moment of invention. In reality the process of technological change was likely to have been more complex, at least in the recent evolutionary past, and that complexity can be seen all around us today. \\n\\nW.B. Arthur, a 'complexity theorist' (The Nature of Technology, 2009) observes that all modern technology works on the principle of 'combinatorial evolution' in which multiple parts are integrated to make a tool, and each of these parts is a tool in its own right and each component is made by other tools which involve other tools, and so on. A random selection of contemporary objects such as a pencil, iPhone, or the Large Hadron Collider illustrates the principle at work, as do basic materials, such as paper, plastic and steel which are themselves made by machinery composed of multiple interacting components. Tools beget tools in an almost self-generating process. Combinatorial evolution speeds the process of innovation with the potential for endless novel combinations of parts to emerge as creative solutions to problems. These new combinations will in turn generate supporting technologies and news fields of expertise. Our growing dependence on the internet for organising our social and economic lives typifies the revolutionary potential of combinatorial evolution as spin-offs, such as apps, emerge at an ever increasing rate. The speed of change is breathtaking, especially from an archaeologist's perspective.\\n\\nThe aim of this study, 'From Hand to Handle', is to trace the archaeological origins of the combinatorial principle, to find out when and where it emerged and to try and understand the social and environmental conditions that spurred its development and spread. At the moment, some of the earliest evidence for tools made from multiple working parts (cutting edges mounted on handles or shafts) comes from the period between 400,000 and 250,000 years ago in Europe, Africa and possibly Asia. This period predates the appearance of our species, Homo sapiens, and it's not clear where exactly the technology began or if it was developed independently by more than one group of early humans and then spread throughout the world. The Hand to Handle project examines the archaeological evidence from each continent to try and resolve the issue of its origin, but also looks at genetic and fossil evidence to determine when early humans had developed enough brain power to imagine new kinds of tools made from multilple parts and different materials. The kind of hierarchical thought involved in envisaging composite tools was also involved in the evolution of language, with the two processes being inextricably linked.\\n\\nOnce developed, composite technology diversified into new forms as illustrated by archaeological examples drawn from the period after 120,000 years ago. The project also involves the study of ethnographic collections of hafted tools held in museums in the UK and USA. These historic artefacts reveal the range of composite tools made by hunter-gatherers from the tropics to the arctic, highlighting the importance of the combinatorial principle in enabling humans to colonise the globe. \\n\\nThe project results will be published as a book by Oxford University Press.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "The concept of combinatorial evolution has been introduced to the private sector and elements of academia (engineers and economists) through the work of complexity theorist W.B. Arthur (The Nature of Technology, 2009). Its application to the human evolutionary record as offered here is new, and has the potential to reach a broader non-academic audience through a coordinated dissemination strategy involving the media (print and electronic), a dedicated website and an exhibition.\\nArchaeology enjoys a high public profile in part through its enduring presence on television (eg, Time Team, Horizon, Discovery Channel) and the media appetite for reporting new discoveries and ideas that challenge preconceptions about early humans. The Hand to Handle project with its interdisciplinary content will appeal to that substantial portion of the public that derives enjoyment and intellectual stimulation from the media coverage of archaeology, anthropology and natural history. The initial dissemination will be through the project monograph which will be written in a format to reach an educated but not exclusively academic audience. The book will be published in 2012 and media dissemination will follow. Media coverage of the findings will be generated through a publicity campaign organised with the help of the University of Liverpool (Corporate Communications) and Oxford University Press. Public dissemination is planned through radio, television and print media as described in more detail in the Pathways to Impact. A dedicated website presented in a non-technical style will feature on the University's publically accessible webpage, and a separate link will be available through the School of Archaeology, Classics &amp; Egyptology 'Unearthed' news page. Discussions are underway with the Victoria Gallery &amp; Museum, Liverpool, to host a From Hand to Handle exhibition. A linked practical handling exhibition will be available for school groups through the Gallery's learning services. Students would be given the opportunity to handle genuine artefacts and create their own composite tools to illustrate the combinatorial principle. A range of modern object will be included to underline the centrality of composite technology in our daily lives. I will present public talks on the subject through the Gallery's adult learners programme and to local archaeological and historical societies.\\n", "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []},

"This proposal seeks funding towards costs of geophysical survey and scientific drilling of Pleistocene lacustrine sediments in East Africa, and their subsequent analyses. The aim of the project is to provide a long, continuous and highly-resolved palaeoenvironmental record that will facilitate tests of hypotheses linking human physical and cultural evolution to environmental variation, by reconstructing climatic and landscape change across critical intervals of the last half-million years of human evolutionary history. \n\nThe planned research is focused on Chew Bahir, a 5 km-deep sediment-filled rift basin in south Ethiopia, close to the important hominin fossil sites at Konso, Omo-Kibish, and east Turkana. Drilling will take place in November-December 2013, to a depth of 400 m, estimated to cover the last 500,000 years. Luminescence, radiocarbon, tephrochronology, palaeomagnetic, and 40Ar/39Ar dating methods will be used to determine the age range and time resolution of the cores. A multi-proxy approach, using sediment geochemistry, biomarker, isotope, pollen and diatoms, will be applied to reconstruct past changes in moisture balance, temperature and catchment vegetation. Statistical techniques will be used to define the most significant climate shifts and periods of maximum variability, and then used to model the natural selection of human populations, measured from regional densities of archaeological sites. Particular focus will be on the time period 135-125 ka in order to test the hypothesis that human range expansion out of Africa took place after a period of strong climatic variability. \n\nThe Chew Bahir project is part of the larger Hominin Sites and Paleolakes Drilling Project (HSPDP), supported by the International Continental Drilling Project (ICDP), by NSF (USA), and by DFG (Germany). The HSPDP involves deep drilling of lacustrine sediments at five globally-significant early hominin sites in Kenya and Ethiopia, including Chew Bahir. The combined core data from all five sites will allow comparison of 4 million years of environmental change with the record of human and mammalian evolution, extinction, cultural innovation, and geographic dispersal. The data will be used to evaluate models of climatic and tectonic forcing of environmental processes and landscape resources, and will facilitate testing of hypotheses linking climate variability to human origins, evolution, population change, extinction, and dispersal from Africa into Eurasia.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "Beneficiaries of this research will include: (1) a wide public audience with interest in human origins; (2) journalists, authors, museum curators, film producers, and teachers, all of whom will have a direct interest in communicating increased understanding of our species evolutionary history; (3) tourism and heritage business in Ethiopia, and related tourism agencies in the UK; (4) policy makers, especially in management of water and terrestrial resources under the extremes of future climate change.\n\nResearch on human origins commands an exceptionally wide range of public attention. Newspapers, magazines, TV and radio frequently report on the latest findings of human fossils, and discuss their significance in understanding our common ancestry. Yet there is still very little scientific understanding of why humans emerged from hominid lineages, and why modern humans spread 'Out of Africa' rather recently. This project, as well as being of direct benefit to a wide range of archaeological, palaeoanthropological and climate change researchers (see 'Academic Beneficiaries') is likely to generate considerable public interest, because it will give a much greater understanding of the environmental forces that have shaped our genetic legacy.\n\nVisual and conceptual models of the impact on early human populations of past environmental crises, and human adaptations to strongly varying environments, arising from this project will attract wide attention of education and media sectors. The Smithsonian Museum' s Human Origins website already includes information about this project (http://humanorigins.si.edu/research/east-african-research/drilling), and will be updated during the coming months and years. We will publicise the project on our institutional websites, and provide material for museum websites in the UK, including the Natural History Museum, London, the Great North Museum at Newcastle, Oxford University Museum, and the National Museum of Wales, Cardiff.\n\nThe project results will also be of value to policymakers, relating to prediction of future changes in water resources, (including hydro-power), and agriculture (especially soil fertility and erosion). Scientists and policy makers will have access to publications resulting from the project, and to project data to be archived in the NERC and NOAA databases.

The data will be used to evaluate models of climatic and tectonic forcing of environmental processes and landscape resources, and will facilitate testing of hypotheses linking climate variability to human origins, evolution, population change, extinction, and dispersal from Africa into Eurasia.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "Beneficiaries of this research will include: (1) a wide public audience with interest in human origins; (2) journalists, authors, museum curators, film producers, and teachers, all of whom will have a direct interest in communicating increased understanding of our species evolutionary history; (3) tourism and heritage business in Ethiopia, and related tourism agencies in the UK; (4) policy makers, especially in management of water and terrestrial resources under the extremes of future climate change.\n\nResearch on human origins commands an exceptionally wide range of public attention. Newspapers, magazines, TV and radio frequently report on the latest findings of human fossils, and discuss their significance in understanding our common ancestry. Yet there is still very little scientific understanding of why humans emerged from hominid lineages, and why modern humans spread 'Out of Africa' rather recently. This project, as well as being of direct benefit to a wide range of archaeological, palaeoanthropological and climate change researchers (see 'Academic Beneficiaries') is likely to generate considerable public interest, because it will give a much greater understanding of the environmental forces that have shaped our genetic legacy.\n\nVisual and conceptual models of the impact on early human populations of past environmental crises, and human adaptations to strongly varying environments, arising from this project will attract wide attention of education and media sectors. The Smithsonian Museum' s Human Origins website already includes information about this project (http://humanorigins.si.edu/research/east-african-research/drilling), and will be updated during the coming months and years. We will publicise the project on our institutional websites, and provide material for museum websites in the UK, including the Natural History Museum, London, the Great North Museum at Newcastle, Oxford University Museum, and the National Museum of Wales, Cardiff.\n\nThe project results will also be of value to policymakers, relating to prediction of future changes in water resources, (including hydro-power), and agriculture (especially soil fertility and erosion). Scientists and policy makers will have access to publications resulting from the project, and to project data to be archived in the NERC and NOAA databases. The high-resolution climate reconstructions achieved by this project will feed directly into validation of computer-based climate models. Improvement of computer simulations through the validation exercise will provide more reliable future predictions for policy makers. The results will be of direct relevance to international commissions, such as IPCC assessment reports.", "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF", "text": "Archaeology", "percentage": 67}, {"id": "EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0", "text": "Climate & Climate Change", "percentage": 33}]}, "researchTopics": {"researchTopic": [{"id": "E32742C9-DE22-4776-82B4-444177FA03AD", "text": "Quaternary Science", "percentage": 34}, {"id": "E9C9696C-19B5-4706-9861-F5E0F93A6092", "text": "Archaeology Of Human Origins", "percentage": 33}, {"id": "7DCAF586-72E2-4881-9251-E72F38AF1CA4", "text": "Palaeoenvironments", "percentage": 33}]}, "rcukProgrammes": {"rcukProgramme": []}, "start": null, "end": null, "participantValues": null}, {"links": {"link": [{"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/BFFA0EE4-F99A-4912-8A24-9AF84549ED8A", "rel": "PI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/814BD473-243C-4CEB-874D-13DD9D3B9332", "rel": "COI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/9A81BB28-D13E-4FC7-971F-5A944D4847AD", "rel": "COI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/6874F10C-07D8-41D7-97F4-C93A460A81E4", "rel": "COI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/40C11836-C04A-4354-94B7-D59E5049CE9C", "rel": "RESEARCH_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/A0A585E0-6B0D-4643-A3A6-47943B4CBFEF", "rel": "LEAD_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/E8117419-718F-4047-BCBA-C18511459A05", "rel": "PP_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/funds/C1C69D6F-B3DD-42CA-82AB-6AE8FD715CA1", "rel": "FUND", "start": 1493593200000, "end": 1627686000000, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/keyfindings/5DB87C45-B9AF-4EE7-AF24-B31DADB96F65", "rel": "KEY_FINDING", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/disseminations/DCDCDFAF-B331-4592-ACA9-98B7196D81DA", "rel": "DISSEMINATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/furtherfundings/40874361-9523-43C2-8B73-28523FB6C381", "rel": "FURTHER_FUNDING", "start": 1546300800000, "end": 1575244800000, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/furtherfundings/8C2E90E1-4AD5-4F4D-AA33-AD84C8375DF8", "rel": "FURTHER_FUNDING", "start": 1548979200000, "end": 1704153600000, "otherAttributes": {}}]}, "ext": null, "id": "B759610C-6C5F-41BE-BF0E-1618C8B7814F", "outcomeid": null, "href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/projects/B759610C-6C5F-41BE-BF0E-1618C8B7814F", "created": 1582643293000, "updated": null, "identifiers": {"identifier": [{"value": "AH/N008804/1", "type": "RCUK"}]}, "title": "Investigating the Deep Roots of Human Behaviour", "status": "Active", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Archaeology Classics and Egyptology", "abstractText": "When did human ancestors start behaving like us? Recent research has shown that our direct ancestor, Homo heidelbergensis, lived in Africa 600,000-200,000 years ago and was probably capable of behaviour such as language, symbol use and complex tool-making.The African archaeological record offers some clues to support this thesis, eg, ochre use, possibly for symbolic purposes, and the invention of tools made of multiple parts.Indirect fossil record evidence suggests that this large-brained species formed extended social networks using language.But all this evidence is sparse, poorly dated, unevenly distributed across the continent and insufficient to answer the questions of how, where, when or why these developments took place. This project aims both to add a significant bank of data to the evidence base and expand its geographical coverage.It will provide a research model archaeologists can use elsewhere to generate more data with which to investigate the deep roots of behaviours once thought to be the hallmark of Homo sapiens.\nA multidisciplinary team will undertake excavation and analysis of three key localities (Victoria Falls, Kalambo Falls, Luangwa Valley) spanning 1100 km of south-central Africa which preserve artefacts from the period associated with H. heidelbergensis,the Early to Middle Stone Age transition,ESA/MSA,filling a large regional gap between the better known records of east and southern Africa.\nThe team includes archaeologists, dating specialists and a research group investigating how stone tools were made and used. Materials with high symbolic content such as beads are unlikely to survive from this period thus our primary focus is on technology as a window on the past. Recent research in east and South Africa points to an invention in tool-making that took place before 300,000 years ago,marking a break with long established traditions of the Early Stone Age. A conceptually new approach to problem solving appeared: the combining of separate parts to invent a new whole. The process of adding a stone to a handle and securing it by various means sounds simple but required levels of planning and learning not previously needed. The individual components were themselves made using other tools, other materials and routines of assembly. This recursive principle of 'combinatorial technology' underpins all later technologies including industrial manufacturing. \nIn the time of H. heidelbergensis we also see selection of purple, red and yellow ochres for purposes unknown but which in later periods have practical and symbolic values. These cognitively and socially complex behaviours, along with the fossil evidence for a large modern-like brain, point to a species that shared much with its descendant H. sapiens. \nWe lack the depth of archaeological data to answer the basic questions of time, place and processes of change that make this a potentially key interval in human evolution. This project addresses the need for an Africa-wide perspective on the ESA/MSA transition. Our regional focus offers a test case of a new model of research integrating the best of new dating methods with innovations in the study of early technology. A 'primitive technologist' embedded in the fieldwork will make and use replica tools from the time of the transition. Contemporary local knowledge about materials used in tool-making will be incorporated in the replication experiments. These data will be used to interpret patterns of microscopic wear that accumulate on artefact surfaces in their making and use.Traces of long decayed handles can now be identified by their distinctive patterns of damage. Organic residues may also survive on tool surfaces under the right conditions for preservation. We will be looking for these traces along with evidence of ochre use in the project sites. The results will be compared with what we already know about the ESA/MSA transition in Africa and the research model evaluated in a multidisciplinary workshop.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "The project offers two types of societal impact linked to education. Stone Age archaeology is now part of the England &amp; Wales primary school curriculum and Zambia's secondary school curriculum. This is an opportunity to increase public understanding of human evolution and research methods used to study the deep past. 1) We will produce formal educational material tailored to national needs, making it widely available and cost effective. 2) Using social media the educational impact will reach a global community. \nIn England &amp; Wales, Key Stage 2 History curriculum now covers Stone Age to Iron Age, focusing on the British archaeological record but incorporating wider Palaeolithic topics, eg, technology and evolution of Homo sapiens. A freely available information pack for schools will be produced with a PowerPoint overview of the Stone Age illustrating the interdisciplinary nature of Palaeolithic research and exercises exploring &quot;what the Stone Age did for us&quot;. Accessible via the project website the presentation will be regularly updated. Seventeen Merseyside schools will be offered replica Palaeolithic artefacts for handling. The selection of replicas will echo the PowerPoint content and link to an exhibition at the Victoria Gallery and Museum (Liverpool) on the origins and influence of combinatorial technology. \nIn Zambia's new curriculum for junior secondary schools, Social Studies topics include archaeological research methods; human evolution; Stone Age hunter-gatherers. Students are introduced to science-based evidence for human origins and asked to reflect on economic, technological and social changes in the Pleistocene. In the PI's experience of Zambian schools groups there is widespread distrust of an evolutionary perspective on human origins stemming from strong religious beliefs and ignorance of how an interdisciplinary narrative of the past is constructed. We will offer teachers an education pack complementing the Social Studies textbook consisting of a timeline and methods poster with an information booklet for teachers explaining how the past is dated, artefacts analysed and Stone Age life reconstructed. Visits to the excavations will be offered to give students and teachers first-hand experience of archaeological research and Stone Age material culture.\nThe project website, the portal for a global audience, will be written with non-specialist viewers in mind, with links to a project blog post and Facebook page. The blog adds a human dimension, showing the daily realities of fieldwork. Post-excavation analyses will be reported as updates from behind the microscope to maintain interest in the project. We will report on the workshop and inform followers when the final volume is published. \nResources, milestones\nThe project website will be online from September 2016; the Key Stage 2 PowerPoint will be online by September 2017. The website will be produced and maintained by Liverpool's School of Histories, Languages &amp; Cultures website coordinator. Replica artefacts will be scanned and 3D printed by York Archaeological Trust. The Merseyside schools will receive a pack of replica artefacts and supporting notes (&pound;1.2k). The schools are already involved in outreach activities with the University of Liverpool. Posters and information packs for 300 Zambian schools will be produced by Gadsden Books, Lusaka (&pound;375). The poster will be produced using PowerPoint poster templates and will be ready, along with teacher information booklet, for the second field season July 2017. The PI will oversee blog entries and maintenance of the Facebook page. Co-I Gowlett will coordinate teacher pack distribution in Liverpool.

Ancient volcanic activity has left numerous ash deposits (tuffs) that can be dated using the radiometric dating method 40Ar/39Ar. Although precise, dates obtained by this method only provide broad envelopes with significant temporal gaps because volcanism is episodic, and tuffs do not always survive across the landscape. Furthermore, despite the abundance of archaeological finds and animal fossils in this region, datable tuffs are rare in the East African Rift. Consequently, age estimation often relies on imprecise relative methods, such as magnetostratigraphy and biostratigraphy. A method for obtaining absolute dates is urgently required in order to correlate all the sedimentary sequences within the eastern rift, as well as across Africa, and to help clarify the wider picture of early human biological and cultural events during the Plio-Pleistocene. Likewise, the South African sites also suffer from dating problems, albeit from different issues. In most of these cases they are karstic infills and only recently, have any absolute methods based on cosmogenic and uranium/lead isotope systems been applied. These techniques also leave huge gaps and/or do not precisely date the fossil or archaeological event of interest. For instance, U/Pb dates generally reflect the ages of over- or underlying flowstone and not that of a fossil.\n\nWe propose to apply a novel luminescence-based method known as infrared-radiofluorescence (IR-RF), which the named researcher co-investigator on this proposal helped to develop, in order to determine the age (i.e. time of deposition) of fossil- and artefact-bearing sediments and/or volcanic tuffs in Kenya, Ethiopia and South Africa and to fill in the time gaps omitted by radiometric techniques. The IR-RF method is widely applicable due to the ubiquitous occurrence of sand sized feldspar mineral grains required for dating and the technique targets potassium- (K-) rich feldspar, one of the most common types of mineral on earth. Recent studies suggest that this methodology has the potential to extend the age range of luminescence dating from 0.5 million years to 4 million years, thus encompassing the majority of the time range over which the human family evolved. \n\nMethods of recording and analyzing luminescence data have developed significantly over the last five years, including improved light detection and more advanced analytical and statistical techniques, all of which have led to new approaches and more flexible ways of processing and visualizing data. Recent technological advances including the development of single photon imaging systems based on electron multiplying charge coupled devices (EMCCD) also suggest that the time is right to bring together and apply some of these new cutting-edge innovations to help achieve more reliable chronologies for early hominin evolution. \n\nThis research will dramatically increase the number of well-dated sequences in areas archiving key evidence for early human evolution and it will enable us to provide significant improvements in correlating human fossil records across Africa. A new and more refined chronological framework will greatly improve our understanding of the diversity of adaptive challenges faced by early hominins since the Pliocene and it will help to shed more light on the hotly debated question of the role of climatic and ecological changes in driving hominin evolution.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "The record of past climate change and its impacts on human evolution provides an ideal context for considering issues surrounding human adaptability, the effects of future climate change, and the response of our species to environmental change. Although, research into chronology and past environments is of no immediate commercial value, it seeks to understand events and processes that despite being lost in time, are of deep interest to most people. We believe that our research can provide a very powerful tool for education and public engagement and we wish to focus the impact of our work on science enrichment. In particular, we would like to target children of primary school age, based on the premise that our research can provide a good vehicle for showcasing how science 'works', and how we know what we think we know. We will develop an educational resource for schools which can be made freely available as a download from our project website. In conjunction with our project partners in the field, we will also seek to directly engage with primary schools situated in the vicinity of our archaeological sites in Kenya, Ethiopia and South Africa by organising visits, giving talks and participating in activities with the children and their teachers. The proposed study will hopefully benefit such local communities for whom cultural heritage relating to human prehistory is a matter of local pride but whom we feel are significantly under-served in current efforts to disseminate scientific knowledge whilst at the same time, being held responsible for taking care of globally important archaeological sites. \n\nOur research in geochronology will also directly add value to fossil collections housed within national institution, and it has the potential to transform the archaeological and geological heritage of each country by providing critical context to many previously undatable collections of fossils and archaeological remains. We are particularly keen to build bridges between higher education and research institutions and we will seek to strengthen collaborative networks between research groups spanning the European and African continents. The project links the major fossil repositories of various countries including the National Museums of Kenya and the Maropeng Visitor Center in the 'Cradle of Humankind World Heritage Site' in South Africa. We are convinced that the proposed new luminescence dating methodology can have a similar impact on human evolutionary studies as the radiocarbon revolution had on archaeology. Although, this project will by no means solve all of the many dating issues, it will aim to provide a template and guidance for how to approach this kind of chronometric work and we expect it to leave a long lasting legacy. We aim to provide site-based data illustrating the power of our new methodological approach and to document our research with powerful case studies representing best practice in the field.

Currently comprising Ice Age deposits preserved within 40m deep ravines on an exposed headland, it represents the most important Neanderthal locality in North Western Europe. Its importance derives from a number of factors but these include: its deep sequence of stratification spanning in excess of 250,000 years, the dense concentration of Neanderthal archaeology, the preservation of Neanderthal human remains and its extensive environmental record. No site in the region offers the opportunity to examine the development of Neanderthal behaviour over such a long time scale and against such a high resolution record of global climate and local environmental change.\n\nThe site has a long history of research spanning over a century of investigation by a number of researchers. The most recent sustained excavations were carried out by Professor Charles McBurney (Cambridge University) between 1960 and 1978; during these seasons high resolution datasets of dense occupation activity were recovered from the sequence. These included over 100,000 lithic artefacts and collections of mega-fauna bones from two discrete 'bone-heap' layers. These have formed an important part of discussions of Neanderthal hunting behaviour since their publication in the 1980s.\n\nInvestigations were last carried out at the site in 1982 and the sections from the McBurney excavations were concreted over to protect this part of the site. Since then the site has remained uninvestigated and effectively unmonitored; no work, remedial preservation, or active management has been carried out.\n\nIn 2010 the Quaternary Archaeology and Environments of Jersey Project was initiated to assess La Cotte and other sites on the island. During the past two seasons our team have identified intact areas of archaeological sediment at La Cotte outside of the concreted area. In 2011 a 4m section of deposit was identified in the western part of the site; this contained finely stratified archaeology preserved within sediments likely to preserve evidence of past environments. These layers form part of a deep geological sequence that has only recently become exposed, as it was previously overlain by discarded spoil from earlier excavations. Recent severe winters had removed this spoil, and exposed the archaeological horizons underneath; these were observed to be completely exposed, saturated and undergoing rapid erosion. Cracks observed within the deposits suggest imminent catastrophic collapse is extremely likely. \n\nThe La Cotte de St Brelade Urgent Stabilisation project has been developed as a rapid response to excavate, sample and stabilise this critical exposed section. It aims to achieve this through a targeted intervention which will ensure both the capture of high-resolution datasets from the exposed layers, grading these back to form a stable slope which will remain intact until a long-term management plan can be implemented. The section in question offers extremely high potential for significant archaeology and environmental evidence, and has already been demonstrated to be exceptionally rich, producing high quantities of mint-condition lithics, as well as bone fragments within organic deposits capable of preserving pollen and plant remains. The threatened deposits appear to have been laid down within the Last Glacial period (110-10 000 BP), have never previously investigated using modern scientific techniques, and produced Neanderthal fossils in the early 20th century.\n\nThe internationally significant scientific resource needs to be saved from on-going, rapid destruction before cold and wetter conditions set in this winter. The rapid response set out in this project will not only prevent the loss of evidence from this part of the site, but will provide new high-resolution datasets which will tell us more about the behaviour and palaeoecology of the last Neanderthals in Northern Europ", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "The La Cotte de St Brelade Urgency and Stabilisation Project forms a necessary, responsive stage to an established project (Quaternary Archaeology and Environments of Jersey). The QAEJ team have been successful during the past 3 years in engaging key non-academic stakeholders and the media in our work. We see the most crucial impact outcome of the urgency phase as being the formation of a medium to long term management plan for the site to ensure that the site is properly managed, protected and researched in the future.\n\nWe have identified the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Jersiaise (site owners), Jersey Heritage and the States of Jersey Planning Department as the three key stakeholders on the island. We have already begun to form, in partnership with these bodies, the La Cotte de St Brelade Working Group to develop a management plan for site. The results of the urgency project will not only directly feed into this process but will crucially form a high-profile impetus towards accelerating the formation and implementation of the management plan.\n\nThe Working Group will directly benefit from the project in terms of developing a better understanding of the importance of the scientific resource at the site (overall significance), risks to the resource and approaches toward mitigating these risks. We will report to the Working Group on these issues at regular intervals throughout and after the urgency phase of work.\n\nThe wider public are identified as an important beneficiary, not only because La Cotte de St Brelade is a well known and celebrated part of the island's heritage but because we have identified ways in which explaining its archaeology can engage the public in aspects of human evolution, responses to climate change and island ecology through a dynamic and compelling long term record of human activity. More constructively wider public engagement can be used to develop momentum on the formation of long term management plans and to demonstrate the utility of the world-class scientic resource at La Cotte in terms of potential commercial value (tourism) and international profile (scientific/heritage prestige). \n\nWider public engagement will be facilitated through media coverage, public interpretation and web access. The project has already attracted considerable media interest, being regularly covered by both the BBC and local Jersey media through 2010 and 2011. BBC coverage this summer on Radio 4's 'Tribes of Science' and BBC1's 'Digging For Britain' has widened our profile, and that of science-based archaeology, further. We will continue to engage the media in our work as the urgency work is undertaken. The information gathered during the project will provide an opportunity to showcase both the remaining archaeological potential of the site and modern scientific archaeological techniques. By feeding results directly to Jersey Heritage, they will be effectively placed to arrange both a public presentation of our work and integration of results into existing museum displays. The medium term possibility of La Cotte forming part of an exhibition at the Natural History Museum, London will also provide an exceptional means of wider dissemination. Access to results from the work will also be made available through UCL, QAEJ, Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Jersiaise and Jersey Heritage web sites.", "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF", "text": "Archaeology", "percentage": 100}]}, "researchTopics": {"researchTopic": [{"id": "59A2A0A2-345A-4E14-85F6-936CA1B268C4", "text": "Science-Based Archaeology", "percentage": 40}, {"id": "E9C9696C-19B5-4706-9861-F5E0F93A6092", "text": "Archaeology Of Human Origins", "percentage": 20}, {"id": "E32742C9-DE22-4776-82B4-444177FA03AD", "text": "Quaternary Science", "percentage": 40}]}, "rcukProgrammes": {"rcukProgramme": []}, "start": null, "end": null, "participantValues": null}, {"links": {"link": [{"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/217077F3-7925-4030-B746-49AFF0A1844C", "rel": "PI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/217077F3-7925-4030-B746-49AFF0A1844C", "rel": "FELLOW_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/03D8AFBB-3EA5-4885-B036-BD4F9F4F9849", "rel": "LEAD_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/03D8AFBB-3EA5-4885-B036-BD4F9F4F9849", "rel": "FELLOW_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/2249EBD2-87E6-4944-9461-7FB276A3023B", "rel": "PP_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/3A5E126D-C175-4730-9B7B-E6D8CF447F83", "rel": "PP_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/funds/CB68093C-E7F6-4915-B1B6-3CAC0334F192", "rel": "FUND", "start": 1328486400000, "end": 1349391600000, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/keyfindings/D395BEFD-7447-42DA-8516-42058B1CCFC4", "rel": "KEY_FINDING", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/researchdatabaseandmodels/2CBB6A26-4ECC-43E7-99DC-13A0D712FF45", "rel": "RESEARCH_DATABASE_AND_MODEL", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}]}, "ext": null, "id": "0BC7FBA2-EE7D-48E4-B18B-ADCA6B1A0B41", "outcomeid": null, "href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/projects/0BC7FBA2-EE7D-48E4-B18B-ADCA6B1A0B41", "created": 1582643293000, "updated": null, "identifiers": {"identifier": [{"value": "AH/J004227/1", "type": "RCUK"}]}, "title": "Makapansgat and the Heritage of South African Palaeoanthropology", "status": "Closed", "grantCategory": "Fellowship", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Archaeology", "abstractText": "Palaeoanthropological research focusing on the early hominids of the South African (SA) Plio-Pleistocene has concentrated historically on a small number of productive fossil sites. These site-based excavations have produced hundreds of hominid fossils representing Australopithecus, Paranthropus, and early Homo, yet any one early hominid species is well-represented from only one or two localities, limiting our understanding of morphological, environmental, and temporal variation of South African hominids. While a few new sites discovered in the past two decades have produced important (and sometimes spectacular) new hominid fossils, there has been no systematic, long-term research effort on a regional scale to locate new fossil sites. This field project will utilise historic mining records to produce a database of coordinate data locating potential palaeoanthropological sites in South Africa, and conduct field reconnaissance to survey and inventory historic mine/ fossil site localities in the field.\n\nOne factor in common to all South African early hominid fossil sites is that they correspond to the locations of historic lime mines that were in operation during the early 20th Century to produce calcium carbonate once required to smelt gold. The known mines (and related fossil sites) were prospected in the Malmani Dolomite Subgroup of the Transvaal Supergroup, which is an extensive sedimentary geological system that outcrops between Kimberley and Polokwane (a distance of approximately 800kms), but similar deposits exist in other parts of the country. Archival records of lime mine companies, and SA Geological Survey maps published in 1953 and 1959 document the location of several dozen limestone and dolomite mines throughout the country, and have been used to extract the coordinate data in order to locate these sites in the field and produce inventories of palaeontological resources such as fossils, datable deposits, and a variety of non-fossiliferous sampling materials (e.g., stable isotopes, palynology). Earlier archives and maps have not yet been incorporated into the database, and document additional mine sites with potential as fossil-bearing sites. \n\nThis project will utilise GIS methods and handheld GPS equipment to conduct a widespread regional field survey and reconnaissance project. Site survey, inventory results and related site documentation will be incorporated into a GIS database, and analysed to prioritise site localities for future sampling, and possible excavation. The fieldwork will focus on location and inventory of sites, and sampling will take place in subsequent field seasons once SAHRA permits have been obtained. The database will be updated continuously, and form the basis for a web-based resource providing information about the project and about the history of South African palaeoanthropology.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "This research will be of value to a variety of non-academic communities, and will contribute to a deeper understanding of our palaeoanthropological heritage, and to the historical context of early palaeoanthropological research in Southern Africa. It will contribute to ongoing developments for South African heritage agencies, museums, schools, and tourism, all of which have been involved in and benefitted from palaeoanthropological research. Internationally, the topic of human evolution is of significant interest for museums, educational documentaries, school programmes, and public discussion. Currently in the UK and elsewhere, an ongoing debate about the role of scientific/ evolutionary versus religious viewpoints on human origins has gained attention from lobby groups and policymakers who develop public school curricular content. In addition, research indicates that public understanding of the scientific evidence regarding climate change and global warming is poor. Studies of environmental evolution can usefully contribute to this discourse, and all research in palaeoanthropology and related fields that illuminates our understanding of the scientific evidence for human evolution is relevant and important for raising public understanding and awareness, and for establishing a scientific basis for appropriate policy on such issues. This research project will contribute to raising public awareness of the significance of human evolution, and will elevate the public profile of the Department of Archaeology at the University of Sheffield as a major international centre for palaeoanthropology. \nThis study will have the following impacts: \n1. Development of a project-dedicated web site to disseminate project results, and serve as an information hub about palaeoanthropology in South Africa and the historic and scientific context of this project. With future student involvement, and activities of a planned Field School in Palaeoanthropology, this will include field blogs and imagery of ongoing fieldwork, site details, and other educational information. The website will provide information relevant to student applicants, media researchers and scientific reporters, and the interested public; \n2. Development of public awareness in South Africa of palaeoanthropological heritage in the broad sense, through involvement with SAHRA, regional development and planning agencies, and other public and government organisations supporting World Heritage Site developments such as the Cradle of Humankind (Sterkfontein), and which monitor fieldwork projects and tourism development;\n3. Opportunities for public engagement: \na) Local museums such as the Arend Diepkirk Museum in Mokopane, and Polokwane Museum in the Limpopo Province, and the Origins Centre at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, maintain a strong interest in local heritage issues, and provide opportunities for public lectures, site tours and volunteer fieldwork (for example, see http://www.origins.org.za/whats_on/talks_at_origins/). During past fieldwork involvement at Makapansgat many such events were successfully arranged, and will remain part of this project's public engagement strategy. \nb) The Archaeology Department, University of Sheffield, sponsors a lecture series on departmental research for the university community and a public audience; and the Archaeological Society also sponsors a public lecture series. A departmental series of short courses in archaeology is offered for public and ongoing education communities, and plans for developments in palaeoanthropology are underway. Potential opportunities will be explored for involvement in other local (Sheffield) public lecture series, such as the Caf&eacute; Scientifique, sponsoring public talks by local researchers, and the Showroom Theatre Adventure Series, presenting short documentary films and other forms of media reaching a broad public community.", "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities":

"leadFunder": "BBSRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Earth Atmospheric and Env Sciences", "abstractText": "Phylogenetic trees underpin reconstructions of evolutionary history and tests of evolutionary hypotheses. As such, they address major questions, such as, how and when did our modern biota come into being, and what is the shape and distribution of biodiversity and extinction? Advances in the acquisition and analysis of genetic sequence data have led to an increasing emphasis and reliance on molecular phylogenies, yet phenotypic evidence (morphology) remains vital. It enables us to make the link between organisms and their environment and thus demonstrate the mechanisms of evolutionary change. It is also the only way to include extinct taxa, and therefore provide a deep time perspective; fossils break up large gaps between the depauperate modern fauna, unlock sequences of evolutionary change (so called 'missing links') and provide a timescale for estimating evolutionary rates, including calibration of molecular clocks. Although morphology is acknowledged to be essential for phylogeny, it is also widely recognized as intrinsically problematic. Developmental and functional linkage can result in suites or modules of non-independent morphological characters and thus misleading patterns with respect to phylogeny reconstruction. These problematic phenomena are acknowledged to exist, but they have been largely ignored; morphological data are routinely taken at 'face value' and are treated as equivalent by both molecular and palaeontological studies. Furthermore, we have no idea about the distribution or influence of these phenomena. As such, our understanding of a range of evolutionary events is undermined, and our ability to reconstruct evolutionary history is limited. \n\nTo directly address the limitations of morphology we will: 1) Quantify the extent and distribution of the problem across the tree of life and across morphological modules; 2) develop methodological toolkits for reliable phylogenetic inference using morphology, with independent molecular and stratigraphic data acting as benchmarks; 3) apply those methods to important evolutionary events that rely on interpretations of morphology but have thus far proved intractable or equivocal, for example, human origins. The outcomes will address specific evolutionary hypotheses, and provide powerful tools, workflows and guides for future analyses by providing new ways of working. This project will bring morphology out of the 19th century and into the 21st.", "techAbstractText": "Morphological data are essential for phylogenetic reconstruction, but are acknowledged to be intrinsically problematic. Character independence is violated due to over-saturation, and functional and developmental linkage. Furthermore, homoplasy is widespread due to convergence, and subjectivity of character definition. \n\nThis project aims to identify the scale and distribution of these problematic phylogenetic phenomena and establish new ways of working that minimize their effects. Identification of misleading morphological moieties will be achieved by 1) investigating the performance of logical a priori subdivisions and modules of morphology (e.g. cranium vs post-cranium, hard vs soft, appendage vs non-appendage, flower vs leaf), and 2) investigating the distribution and prevalence of cliques of inter-dependent and ecologically linked characters as identified a posteriori. The performance of different phylogenetic techniques will be directly compared and assessed: 1) implied weighting which minimizes homoplasy, 2) clique removal to minimize character over-saturation, 3) and Bayesian inference to overcome the problems associated with traditional parsimony analysis. Congruence with independent data will be used as a benchmark - primarily molecular trees, which are comparatively well-validated and based on abundant data. No single instance of congruence is authoritative, but meta-analysis of combined data from different sources, clades, and authors mitigates the effect of spurious congruence that might occur in any one dataset. Meta-analysis therefore provides a very powerful tool to identify legitimate broad scale patterns that are consistent for data from a range of sources, authors and clades. The application of these meta-analyses will provide an invaluable guide for future phylogenetic research.", "potentialImpact": "The research findings, namely new ways of working with phylogeny, will have direct impact in a range of areas from evolution biology, to biodiversity and conservation. Much of this impact will be achieved via academic intermediaries following uptake of those guidelines, application to morphological data, and then publication and utilization of the resulting phylogenies. To maximize this, research findings will be disseminated to a broad range of phylogenetic practitioners through varied conferences and publication in high-profile and specialized journals. Outside of this, more direct impact will be achieved in the field of systematics. Studies of biodiversity and conservation are entirely reliant on taxonomy (i.e. species classification), which is in turn based on interpretation of phenotype and morphological characteristics. As such, our research findings will have a direct impact on taxonomic practices, and thus study and preservation of biodiversity. Our roadmap of aspects of morphology that better reflect evolutionary history will therefore be informative for taxonomy. We will directly target the communities of academic and non-academic taxonomists (museum professionals, curators, collectors etc.) through dedicated meetings and articles.\n\nMore broadly, the research will be a great vehicle to improve public understanding of science. As evidenced by extensive media coverage of palaeontology, the fossil record and evolution are of great interest to the public. This is especially true of human origins, which is one of the key case studies to be analysed in this project. The results from this part of the project will be prioritized for outreach, both through exhibition in collaboration with the Manchester Museum, as well as other events and press releases. Both the PI and Co-I have a strong track record of public engagement through participation in events, online presence, and broader dissemination.", "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF", "text": "Archaeology", "percentage": 0}, {"id": "C23BE70F-1EF6-4CC7-88B0-841CB18DD875", "text": "Genetics & development", "percentage": 0}, {"id": "1A1A6805-9DC4-4BCE-BC70-9F2AA4FD093B", "text": "Ecol, biodivers. & systematics", "percentage": 0}]}, "researchTopics": {"researchTopic": [{"id": "62F9C365-02D0-4623-9A73-8CA09DA0FFF2", "text": "Evolution & populations", "percentage": 0}, {"id": "E9C9696C-19B5-4706-9861-F5E0F93A6092", "text": "Archaeology Of Human Origins", "percentage": 0}, {"id": "0E919A46-F083-4A92-8B31-A5AC7039CDE4", "text": "Palaeobiology", "percentage": 0}, {"id": "2CF6994C-A1AE-435B-853C-2C228927BC9E", "text": "Systematics & Taxonomy", "percentage": 0}]}, "rcukProgrammes": {"rcukProgramme": []}, "start": null, "end": null, "participantValues": null}, {"links": {"link": [{"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/604465CE-F824-49E0-91E6-A8DDC6101350", "rel": "PI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/A5AAFE66-07AD-4404-8845-987C5DB4360B", "rel": "COI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/E89C3602-0FB4-4044-A918-58966B8A10B2", "rel": "LEAD_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/funds/3F213C48-0E26-4766-B709-94B223186517", "rel": "FUND", "start": 1459465200000, "end": 1506726000000, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/keyfindings/12BD0620-21EE-4224-911B-D9D36ED80591", "rel": "KEY_FINDING", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/disseminations/C2862A05-68BD-4688-887D-50D055C32290", "rel": "DISSEMINATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/disseminations/EA5050E2-C86F-42C8-8F26-4015B357A3CB", "rel": "DISSEMINATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/disseminations/500C3DA5-D585-4708-B1B4-7D51915EBA73", "rel": "DISSEMINATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/disseminations/2CFC6B54-B76B-4D25-8EE7-89EC35D661ED", "rel": "DISSEMINATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/disseminations/C58AA699-9D53-47EC-8109-6060A9CCD7B0", "rel": "DISSEMINATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/disseminations/6749C341-8174-4E69-A7FF-7479FDF0C888", "rel": "DISSEMINATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/impactsummaries/C6F070C3-55CE-496D-BB44-F3B559F8477A", "rel": "IMPACT_SUMMARY", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/DBE7FEF3-CF0D-4F06-A1ED-C6DC81C0CFF4", "rel": "PUBLICATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/11BB5B8F-FD55-489A-9C26-A3D91A7D67B9", "rel": "PUBLICATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}]}, "ext": null, "id": "AF90FB66-3E10-4D02-9389-29AD6CD65FE9", "outcomeid": null, "href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/projects/AF90FB66-3E10-4D02-9389-29AD6CD65FE9", "created": 1582643293000, "updated": null, "identifiers": {"identifier": [{"value": "AH/N007514/1", "type": "RCUK"}]}, "title": "Coping with climate: the legacy of H. heidelbergensis", "status": "Closed", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Archaeology", "abstractText": "We've all seen, whether in books, museums or on television and other media, representations of our early human ancestors, typically naked or with only the most limited forms of animal skin 'clothing'. We've also all woken up on cold winters' mornings, and crawled back under the duvet (or spent ten minutes de-icing the car). These themes of behaviour, material culture and climate, and the connections between them, are central to the story of Europe's earliest humans, who date back at least one million years.\n\nThe proposed research network therefore aims to address two fundamental evolutionary questions: firstly, what were the 'globalising' adaptations of Homo heidelbergensis (a key early human species in Europe, which existed prior to the Neanderthals and our own species, Homo sapiens)? In practical terms such adaptations would be required for early humans to deal successfully with the varying day-to-day challenges brought on by the changing latitudes and longitudes encountered during dispersals through Eurasia: e.g. long winters, short days, and marked seasonality. These factors would have impacted significantly on issues as varied as food availability, climatic tolerances, human technological and social behaviours, inter-species interactions (as suggested by recent palaeogenetic studies), and even human morphology and speciation events (the evolution of new human species). Secondly, how have those 'globalising' adaptations contributed to the evolution of our own species' abilities to manage climatic and environmental challenges (both past and present)?\n\nThese questions are currently unanswered, despite the fact that during the last twenty years researchers have come to recognise that the emergence of our own species, H. sapiens, was a more gradual and complex process than the 'human revolution' perspectives of the late 1980s (that older viewpoint argued that there was a rapid and dramatic 'step-change' in human behaviour, which appeared with H. sapiens). However even the newer perspectives continue to ignore over 1 million years of human evolution: this is the period sandwiched between the first dispersals of older human species from Africa (occurring around 1.8 million years ago) and the first appearance of H. sapiens (around 200,000 years ago in Africa). Yet the intervening period is critical to our understanding of human behavioural evolution, because H. heidelbergensis (whose European fossils are mostly dated to between 600,000 and 400,000 years ago) is widely recognised as our last common ancestor (albeit one that we also shared with the Neanderthals), and was also the first human species to engage successfully and enduringly with the new climatic and environmental challenges faced during those initial dispersals from Africa. This species, and other early Europeans such as Homo antecessor, are thus an invaluable test case for developing our understanding of how early humans met the challenges of Eurasian environments, and the associated implications for evolutionary developments in hominin technology, social life, and cognition.\n\nThe overall goal of the network is therefore to engage academics (e.g. from archaeology, palaeoenvironmental studies, palaeoclimatology, palaeogenetics, and anthropology), stakeholder groups (bushcraft organisations, museums and teachers), and the general public with the dynamic realities of Pleistocene (Ice Age) life and behaviour: e.g. taking paleoclimatologists from the climate model to the realities of a cold winter morning, while taking archaeologists from the stone tool to the dynamics of animal migrations and plant food security. This will advance our knowledge and understanding across multiple research fields, an exercise which is the only means of coming to understand the complex dynamics and the realities of the great dispersals of our human past. The trans-disciplinary approach proposed by this network application is the first step in achieving this goal.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "Who will benefit from this research?\n\nThe principal non-academic beneficiaries of the research will be:\n\n- School teachers and pupils;\n- Local, regional and national museum organisations;\n- The general public (museum visitors).\n\nThe principal intended impacts on the above groups will emphasise:\n\n- The day-to-day survival strategies of Britain's earliest ice age humans;\n- The ice age lives which lie behind museums' stone tool collections;\n- The importance of present-day, hunter-gatherer cultures in developing understanding of our European past.\n\nThe project will thus emphasise:\n\n- A re-alignment in the presentation and dissemination of 'origins' archaeology, placing greater emphasis upon the (Palaeolithic) realities of living within (Pleistocene) worlds: helping visitors to see stone tools not as type x or y, but rather in the context of the risks (e.g. climate, predators, injury) of travelling a few kilometres from a 'safe' sleeping site to a source of stone for tool-making.\n\n- Bushcraft organisations and experimental archaeological outreach demonstrators: developing the general public's perception of bushcraft skills and hunter-gatherer lifestyles, with reference to their varied roles in helping all of us to understand both our contemporary environments and our human pasts.\n\nThese impacts will be achieved through a variety of means, primarily:\n\n- The &quot;Day in the Ice Age&quot; event (hosted at Reading Museum) which will demonstrate, and engage school groups and the general public with, the theme of practical Ice Age survival strategies (e.g. wild foods, pyrotechnology, shelters and clothing). Schools from Reading and Brighton and the surrounding regions will receive targeted invitations to the respective events. The events will also promote the project's resources (see below; to be circulated through the project's hub website).\n\n- Teaching resources for schools. These resources will be explicitly targeted at Key Stage 2, and current needs for resources to support the teaching of prehistory in the curriculum. These needs have been established, and resource types identified, through discussions with Reading University's Institute of Education and teaching consultancies (Schools Prehistory). Resources will include: lesson plans; image banks (e.g. of artefacts; reconstructions of Ice Age environments, hominin habitats and behaviours); Palaeolithic (= Old Stone Age) Timeline; 'Fundamentals' Fact-Sheets (Palaeolithic chronology and behaviour, and Ice Age environments); video-clips &amp; photographs (practical Ice Age survival techniques; e.g. tool-making; processing of animal skins; exploitation of wild plant foods); digital 3D PDF models of artefacts (for display) and files for 3D printer replication; practical exercises (e.g. 'human' timelines); and links to existing web-based resources (see the Pathways to Impact document for further details). \n\n- Evaluation of the &quot;Day in the Ice Age&quot; event and the school resources (e.g. level of event participation and resource take-up, and evidence of modified practices [e.g. in teaching]), through pre- and post-event on-line surveys and interviews/discussions via Skype, email and in person.\n\n- Evaluation of the &quot;Day in the Ice Age&quot; event and school resources will lead to a set of recommendations, to be shared with the British Museum and the Museums Association (http://www.museumsassociation.org/), for consideration as a model for the promotion of Palaeolithic archaeology to the general public.\n\n- The integration of stakeholder groups (teachers, bushcraft organisations and local, regional and national museums) and academic participants throughout the project, ensuring that schools, museums and bushcraft groups are active participants in the creation of the research, rather than static (and perhaps unwilling) 'recipients' of the project's outcomes and/or 'visual illustrators' of hunter-gatherer behaviours (e.g. tool-making and animal skins preparation).", "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF", "text": "Archaeology", "percentage": 0}, {"id": "020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3", "text": "Social Anthropology", "percentage": 0}, {"id": "EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0", "text": "Climate & Climate Change", "percentage": 0}]}, "researchTopics": {"researchTopic": [{"id": "0E919A46-F083-4A92-8B31-A5AC7039CDE4", "text": "Palaeobiology", "percentage": 0}, {"id": "E9C9696C-19B5-4706-9861-F5E0F93A6092", "text": "Archaeology Of Human Origins", "percentage": 0}, {"id": "E32742C9-DE22-4776-82B4-444177FA03AD", "text": "Quaternary Science", "percentage": 0}, {"id": "020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3", "text": "Social Anthropology", "percentage": 0}, {"id": "7DCAF586-72E2-4881-9251-E72F38AF1CA4", "text": "Palaeoenvironments", "percentage": 0}]}, "rcukProgrammes": {"rcukProgramme": []}, "start": null, "end": null, "participantValues": null}, {"links": {"link": [{"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/D8512246-FE4D-44E4-AAD8-7B849B6D9C94", "rel": "PI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/FB2BEE53-C603-4DA8-93A4-5EBCD22E75E8", "rel": "COI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/5EF9E33F-A9B5-4A99-A554-A1B51A9F4BC9", "rel": "COI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/0838B2E1-D5E2-4ACD-AA27-D2B1BFDC124F", "rel": "LEAD_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/funds/3AF535C4-C48C-4A75-86AB-34F4AEF8E1AA", "rel": "FUND", "start": 1546387200000, "end": 1569884400000, "otherAttributes": {}}]}, "ext": null, "id": "5B1B058C-EB53-46CE-BE4E-6FF2A0288A5D", "outcomeid": null, "href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/projects/5B1B058C-EB53-46CE-BE4E-6FF2A0288A5D", "created": 1582643293000, "updated": null, "identifiers": {"identifier": [{"value": "AH/S005196/1", "type": "RCUK"}]}, "title": "Continuing Bonds: Creative Dissemination", "status": "Active", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Sch of Life Sciences", "abstractText": "We do not speak of the dead often enough: we lack the language, the opportunity, the encouragement, and someone to listen.

These were some of the key findings from the AHRC-funded 'Continuing Bonds: Exploring the meaning and legacy of death through past and contemporary practice' (CB) project, which has investigated the value and contribution of archaeology to end-of-life care. \n\nThis follow-on project brings the stories, narratives, themes and experiences espoused in the CB findings, as well as inspiring archaeological/ethnographic materials, to wider audiences. \nInvolving creative writers and the general public, four activities are proposed: \n1. A series of creative writing workshops \n2. Collation and dissemination of an anthology \n3. Celebration reading events \n4. Development of a free resource pack \n \nStories told in the original Continuing Bonds study, as well as archaeological/ethnographic materials, will be used to inspire participants' creative writing, as well as normalise facets of death, dying and bereavement (DDB). These materials will focus on a range of stories, narratives, themes (such as memorialisation and legacy, ethics, and treatment of the dead), experiences and objects. The workshops will provide a safe space for individuals to talk about DDB, to engage with others' stories and experiences about these and to engage with case studies about DDB from the past. Participants will be asked to produce pieces of creative writing, such as short stories, flash fiction (short fictional work which still offers character and plot development) and poetry. By engaging individuals in these topics through the medium of writing, it is likely that a wider understanding of DDB will emerge, with DDB thoughts, behaviours and practices being validated and normalised. These impacts will continue through the anthology and the celebration reading events. \n \nThe anthology will include approximately 45 pieces. These will have been developed through the creative writing workshops. This will be free to access and hosted online. Free print copies will also be made available for contributors, their friends/family and other interested parties. \n \nThe celebration events will welcome all who have attended the workshops, submitted to the anthology, and the general public.

We anticipate that participants will be attracted by the unique inspiration provided by the archaeological materials and related participant accounts, as well as the opportunity to network with other writers and to showcase and receive feedback on their work. \n \nOverall, the Creative Dissemination proposal takes the success of the original CBs project and extends this to new audiences, using the medium of creative writing.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "Impact is expected through the activities (creative writing workshops and celebration events), and outputs (anthology and workshop resource), as well as the preparation of conference papers for practice-based and public audiences. \n \nThe workshops will encourage participants to make connections with each other, with individuals benefiting from focused time to write, access to unique and original inspiration material, peer feedback from others in the group and the opportunity to publish and share their work. They may find their writing skills as well as their confidence in sharing their writing improves. Writing for a deadline can help motivate individuals and encourage them to dedicate 'protected time' to creating. Further, individuals will gain new learning and knowledge about DDB, including thinking and behaviours which tend not to be discussed in society, but which are natural and normal. \n \nThe anthology (including around 45 pieces) will have a print run of 500 copies, distributed free of charge to participants and their families. Copies will also be disseminated to key libraries in the cities and local bereavement support institutions (such as Bradford Bereavement Support; CRUSE Bereavement Care), University libraries, and other interested venues. The anthology will also be available free of charge online, via the University of Bradford and Continuing Bonds Project websites. We will invite comment from key voices around the topic, encouraging blogs on the anthology from influential individuals and blog sites, as well as other AHRC funded projects (e.g. Grave Goods and Remember Me), and from important bodies such as the Centre for Death Studies. Writers and poets will have a free space to showcase their work. \n \nThe celebration events will be open to all who have attended the workshops, their family and friends, interested parties and to the general public. The aim is for individuals to showcase their anthology submissions. This will provide a valuable reflective opportunity for those involved and enables members of different writing communities to join together. It is hoped that this will form the basis of ongoing informal networks among participants and with CoI JD who intends to continue working in the field of creative writing. Furthermore, the nature of the material (based on death, dying and bereavement) will promote conversations between contributors and their families and friends attending the event about these topics. \n \nA downloadable resource pack of workshop materials and accompanying guide to delivery will be made available, free of charge, hosted by the University of Bradford. This will enable the Follow-on project to have greater impact beyond the immediate workshop participants and their families, friends and peers. \n \nIn the work we have undertaken so far, and the outcomes of that work, it has become apparent that the disciplines of psychology, particularly counselling psychology, and creative writing share many commonalities and can usefully inform each other. The Creative Dissemination project will reveal further commonalities between the two, particularly understanding of how research methods and findings can inform the content and processes of writing. This may lead to further interdisciplinary work and research. \n \nFinally, a conference paper for a practice-based audience (our research to date suggests that Psychology would be the most appropriate field) will be produced, which outlines how the Creative Dissemination project came about, how it was implemented, gives examples of the writing work created, and showcases what the consequences and impacts of the project have been. This paper would allow practitioners to take our learning back into their own work in a tangible way.

"grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Faculty of Humanities", "abstractText": "The 'Caveman' persists in the popular imagination as typifying the original human condition. This is despite over 150 years of continuous discovery and the development of our sophisticated understanding of the human evolutionary path. But even with these advances it has proved difficult to shake off the widely held perception that our ancestors led a precarious existence made only bearable by the use of caves as the original primitive home.\nOur research programme will scrutinise the evidence for the early human use of caves. By doing so we hope to shift fundamentally the perception of our cave dwelling ancestors for both academics and the wider public.\nThe fact is that for the majority of human evolution we find little or no clear evidence as to where our ancestors were living. This has led to suggestions that they occupied landscapes rather like other animals. Perhaps this involved using impermanent shelters which left no trace in the archaeological record. However, this situation appears to change quite rapidly across the world after half a million years ago. From this point on we start to see, in Africa, Asia and Europe, early human populations who now occupied caves for extended periods of time. Therefore far from the use of caves representing an original, primitive, human condition, their use points instead to a revolution in human behaviour; A revolution in the use of space, technology, landscape and the conception of time; A revolution that has been overlooked by archaeologists but whose implications are immense.\nOur research project will begin with the detailed analysis of a key site which shows this new behaviour. La Cotte de St Brelade is a spectacular cave system on the south coast of the island of Jersey. It provides evidence for the long term occupation of the site by Neanderthals hunters spanning almost 200,000 years. During over a century of excavation it has produced one of the largest collections of Neanderthal artefacts and other remains known from Europe. And yet the archive has remained inaccessible for a generation and has never been subjected to a complete analysis.\nWe intend to bring modern, scientific archaeological analysis to bear on the unique collections of material from la Cotte de St Brelade. We will do this in order to study in detail the changing nature of human behaviour at the site. We want to know to what extent the site represents a Neanderthal 'home'; how the Neanderthals at the site used the landscape around them; and how they organised themselves socially to become a highly effective species with a long and successful history of settlement in the region.\nWe will use the la Cotte study as a springboard to develop a new understanding of this radical way of life. We will do this by comparing our findings to other cave sites in Europe which have similar evidence for the development of long-lived settlement sites; Sites where time takes on a vertical dimension for the first time and where the quantity of evidence allows us to call them 'super-sites'.\nIn the final part of our project we aim to bring together researchers from around the globe who are researching sites showing similar revolutionary behaviour. This will provide a global perspective on the evolutionary significance of the use of caves. Our research will provide the opportunity to determine what sustained cave occupation means for our understanding of human development. It also opens the door to exploring the immensely exciting possibility that the cavemen of popular imagination actually represent a fundamentality transformative phase in the human evolutionary path.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "1. Formation of a La Cotte de St Brelade Working Group: Progress has already been made this during 2012 to form a La Cotte de St Brelade Working Group to over see both the immediate remedial measures outlined in this project and the formation of a long term management plan. The working group will comprise key representatives from the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Jersiaise, Jersey Heritage, the State Planning Department and other identified stakeholders. Academic representatives from the UK and the continent will also be invited to participate/comment. By reporting to the working group directly at regular monthly intervals during the project, momentum towards long term management can be maintained through direct and meaningful engagement.\n\n2. Public Engagement: The information gathered during the project will provide an opportunity to show case both the remaining archaeological potential of the site and modern scientific archaeological techniques. By feeding results directly to Jersey Heritage, they will be effectively placed to arrange both a public presentation of our work and integration of results into existing and new museum displays. The medium term possibility of La Cotte forming part of an exhibition at the Natural History Museum London, will also provide an exceptional means of wider dissemination.\n\n3. Media Engagement: Our project has already attracted considerable media interest, being regularly covered by both the BBC and local Jersey media through 2010 and 2011. BBC coverage this summer on Radio 4's Tribes of Science and BBC1's Digging For Britain has widened our profile further. Further documentary filming is planned for 2012 and negotiations already underway for a focused series of programme on the archaeology of the site. \n\n4. Web Coverage: An account of the project will be provide, along with results as they are published on both our own QAEJ website, the UCL main web site and web sites maintained by Jersey Heritage and the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Jersiaise.\n\n5. International Promot The States of Jersey are keen to showcase the island internationally in terms of natural resources and diversity of interests. The ancient human archaeology of the island is proving itself to be an effective way to promote the island as a whole, widening at the same time, an awareness of the increasingly detailed picture of ancient human life we aim to develop in the course of the work.", "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject":

"Closed", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "NERC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Faculty of Humanities", "abstractText": "European Cave art is one of the most striking examples of Ice Age archaeology and one of the most important sources of information about the belief systems, symbolic behaviour and aesthetic abilities of the earliest known artists. While its specific meaning will probably always remain hotly debated, it is undoubtedly one of the most intimate windows to the cultural past. However, uncertainties about its exact age seriously hamper our understanding of nearly all aspects of cave art, particularly its relationship to the archaeology that is found below ground and which constitutes the majority of the record of Ice Age human behaviour and behavioural change. We will considerably redress this situation by producing one of the largest corpuses of radiometric dates for the core regions of Palaeolithic cave paintings and engravings; Spain, France and Italy. The results will allow us to determine whether Neanderthals created some of the earliest art, or whether it was a behaviour restricted to our own species; and how it evolved thematically and stylistically over time from place to place. Providing reliable dates for particular artistic themes and styles will allow us to relate the changing artistic traditions to the social and behavioural changes that are recorded in the below ground archaeological record.\n\nAt present it is still not certain when cave art first appeared in Europe. Radiocarbon has been used to provide dates for the organic pigments used in cave paintings, but many of the results remain controversial. Organic pigments may become contaminated by the much older limestone of the walls of caves, or the charcoal used to make a black pigment could have been old at the time the art was made. Furthermore, radiocarbon can only date carbon based pigments, but the majority of early cave art is either engravings with no pigments, or use mineral pigments such as red ochre that is unsuitable for the radiocarbon method. Many engravings and paintings were created directly on, or became overlain by, calcium carbonate layers formed by the same process as stalagmites and stalactites. We can establish when these layers formed by uranium-series dating, a technique that measures the ratio of uranium to its radioactive decay product thorium. By so doing a minimum or maximum age can be calculated for the art, and by measuring enough examples a chronology for the emergence of the art and its subsequent development and spread of different styles can be constructed. \n\nIn a pilot project we successfully dated 50 carbonate samples from 11 caves in northern Spain, showing that art in this region appeared 20,000 years earlier that was previously thought, and that it appeared in the period in which the last Neanderthals were disappearing and the first modern humans (Homo sapiens) were arriving. These results raised the possibility that Neanderthals created some of the earliest examples of cave art. If true, this would fit with the emerging picture of symbolic use of pigments by Neanderthals, and would raise our understanding of their behavioural and cognitive capacities significantly. To unravel this requires a far more ambitious project, proposed here, since the distribution of the earliest art may help us understand if it arrived in Europe with the first modern humans; whether it was developed by them only later; or indeed whether some of it can be attributed to the Neanderthals. To address these questions we will date cave art associated with datable carbonate layers in 49 caves in the regions where cave art is most abundant; Spain, France and Italy, and produce the largest database of reliably dated cave art so far produced.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "The enhancement through this project of our understanding of several UNESCO World Heritage cave art sites and other cave art sites in Spain, France and Italy, will benefit the general public through a visitor experience enriched by our research. In addition to the increase in available data the project will provide an excellent example of how cutting edge scientific techniques interface with arts and humanities approaches which are more traditionally associated with the presentation of cave art to the public at the interpretation centres associated with our impact strategy.\n\n\nMuseums (specifically Creswell Crags Museum and Education Centre, and the National Museum of Altamira) will benefit through these enhanced displays and interpretations (see Pathways to Impact) and through the enhanced visitor numbers our research and associated publicity will attract. At Creswell Crags a key strategic aim of the Creswell Heritage Trust is the regeneration of an economically-deprived area through the creation of a major visitor attraction. Adding value to the existing Creswell resource, through demonstrating its shared international artistic heritage, and by using it to disseminate cutting edge science, will contribute to this aim.\n\n\nRegional communities in the hinterland of such cave art visitor attractions will benefit economically through increased visitor numbers, as a direct result of the publicity and events associated with our research.\n\n\nOther educational institutions will benefit from the creation of an 'active archive' in the form of learning resources such as a pop-up exhibition, which can be provided to schools, colleges, museums, universities and other educational institutions on an ongoing basis.", "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity":

revolutionize landscape, site, and artefact analyses by bringing new transformative digital recording methods and computed analysis to fields that are traditionally labour intensive. The scale of the resultant technology and capability will generate a paradigm shift in the way that spatial and functional data are studied in heritage sciences.\n\nConventional 'refit analysis' requires an expert to study thousands of individual pieces from prehistoric archaeological sites and try to find pieces that fit together, eventually reconstructing objects, such as stone tool cores. Due to the size and complexity of these sites, it makes them important for understanding past human behaviour, however this also makes them the least understood by archaeologists and the public. The amount of effort this requires increases exponentially with assemblage size and generally entire sites can not be studied. Automation of this process will transform working practices bringing rapid and total surveys in reach of many more projects. The implications of such capability are widespread. At a site and landscape level the addition of digital recording, automated capture and processing to augment landscape survey will enhance the ability to archaeologically record and resolve complex surface scatters in landscapes, this will also allow sites that have previously been too remote and inhospitable to be surveyed. \n\nWork can then be done faster and allow areas for targeted survey to be identified easily and safely. At a macro scale, the method will resolve complex associations facilitating interpretation through visualisations and aiding physical reconstruction. The generation of high fidelity digital output will enable closer working of researchers across traditional boundaries and will benefit the specialist and nonspecialist alike. These combined transformative scalable approaches to refit analysis will have broad application to all disciplines working with objects across the arts and humanities - ranging from three-dimensional artists to heritage professionals such as conservators/ restorers and even impacting on other disciplines such as forensic science.\n\nOutputs of the project will be highly visual and are tailored to maximise impact with the involvement of a visual artist as an integral part of the project team. The project teams involved in the various work packages involve high profile international co-investigators.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "Heritage practitioners and curators will have immediate benefit through hands on learning and knowledge transfer as a result of attending the project workshop. Small bursaries will be offered to increase the range of those able to attend. The workshop combines a series of short lectures and demonstration of equipment and documentation. There will be a better understanding of the potential for the use of all the developed and used advanced methods and the ways to present their data to a broader audience.\n\nThe project outputs are aimed at practitioners outside of academia such as curators, object handlers and excavators. The consequence of this will be a better understanding of the value of integrated approaches of analysis across archaeology and refit, microwear and landscape imaging as interpretive tools. This crosses over to a gained understanding of the complexity of site scale and the importance of artefact context and embedded data. This will improve communication between curators, heritage specialists, and researchers about the best practices for conservation and analysis of material to study site activities and function.\n\nThe methods developed and under investigation are capable of producing images of high quality that illustrate clusters of tools, how these fit together to understand activity areas and locations of production, and wear from tool use on early prehistoric implements. The effect of visualising this allows data to be communicated to a wide audience. This presents opportunities for museums to display high quality images of tools in a way that is unprecedented and useful for public engagement. The nature of these images means that they can be appreciated as they are. Direct observation of wear is the only current way to adequately showcase its features to the public, this situation changes with the presentation of the high resolution, high depth images produced by laser scanning systems. The surfaces can be visualised as a sort of 3D landscape and displayed in interactive systems, moving beyond a simple digital photograph. The integration of 3D data at multiple scales producing zoomable interactive models and the ability to digitally fit artefacts from across sites together will create a grand experience. This extends to the media whereby the quality of the output from such systems is far more suitable for the needs of print.\n\nThe quality of data. High quality data in archaeology leads to high quality interpretations and a better understanding of the archaeological record and, in this case early prehistoric archaeology. The impact to society is that the research forms the basis of good method that has the onward impact of producing a quality interpretation and presentation of heritage, early prehistoric life, and human evolution to the public.\n\nThe development of interactive high quality experiences on the web would provide an understanding of the sites and artifacts that can be shared with the public. Crowd sourced high resolution images of fossiliferous deposits would provide a unique opportunity for citizen science. Downloadable files for use with low cost 3D printers, will also provide an innovative pathway to engage with the public and provide a tactile approach to present heritage.", "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69", "text": "Visual arts", "percentage": 0}, {"id": "FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951", "text": "Tools, technologies & methods", "percentage": 0}, {"id": "6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF", "text": "Archaeology", "percentage": 0}]}, "researchTopics": {"researchTopic": [{"id": "80A9D6C5-792D-4DD9-9138-BEC1BB556AA9", "text": "Technology and method dev", "percentage": 0}, {"id": "14AE809A-4116-46B5-ABF7-DF8BCE2BF069", "text": "Prehistoric Archaeology", "percentage": 0}, {"id": "8BB67751-1AD5-4EE8-9104-089D5F236DDB", "text": "Digital Arts HTP", "percentage": 0}, {"id": "E9C9696C-19B5-4706-9861-F5E0F93A6092", "text": "Archaeology Of Human Origins", "percentage": 0}, {"id": "59A2A0A2-345A-4E14-85F6-936CA1B268C4", "text": "Science-Based Archaeology", "percentage": 0}]}, "rcukProgrammes": {"rcukProgramme": []}, "start": null, "end": null, "participantValues": null}, {"links": {"link": [{"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/AC6C0E6D-4B79-4F7E-9F2D-7EC7001E9307", "rel": "PI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/961756BF-E31F-4A13-836F-0A09BA02385C", "rel": "LEAD_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/0BD33612-D37E-4331-8684-7A096505AC4F", "rel": "PP_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/funds/F3D4C4D3-4994-44E0-B5A3-27261257B2C6", "rel": "FUND", "start": 1546300800000, "end": 1609372800000, "otherAttributes": {}}]}, "ext": null, "id": "481A8D0F-D805-4958-A897-E7082A65836C", "outcomeid": null, "href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/projects/481A8D0F-D805-4958-A897-E7082A65836C", "created": 1582643293000, "updated": null, "identifiers": {"identifier": [{"value": "AH/S003541/1", "type": "RCUK"}]}, "title": "Widening participation and increasing access to Cultural Heritage and Natural Science Activities in Georgia.", "status": "Active", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Theology", "abstractText": "Georgia has suffered a series of crises since the end of communism in 1991, suffering a civil war, the loss of Abkhazia and, since 2008 Tskhinvali/South Ossetia has been occupied by the Russian army. This means that there are up to 232,700 IDPs in Georgia (http://www.internal-displacement.org/europe-the-caucasus-and-central-asia/georgia/figures-analysis) out of a population of 3.9 million (http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/georgia-population/) which equates to almost 17% of the overall population of the country. 20% of the country's territory is occupied by Russia (https://www.georgianjournal.ge/politics/34274-10-years-after-putins-invasion-russia-still-occupies-parts-of-georgia-daily-signal.html) and these factors have placed a significant social, political and economic strain on society. Added to this the population of Tbilisi is now officially 1,225,000 (http://tbilisiguide.ge/w/about_georgia.php) although it is believed the real total is higher, and this movement from the villages to the capital has precipitated a crisis in life opportunities for many young people.\n\nEducational needs\n\nTo place this initiative in a wider context, it must be understood that there is such chronic underfunding of the Georgian schools system that children attend in two shifts - 10.00-14.00 and 14.00-18.00 meaning that no child studies for a full day as is normal in most other European countries. In addition the extremely long holidays and many National Bank Holidays further curtail the school year, as does the widespread practice of children being withdrawn for the last 2 weeks of term each academic year and sent off to relatives in the provinces. In the villages, school buildings are often almost derelict Soviet era constructions that are dangerously unstable and teachers earn in the region of 300 Lari (less than &pound;90) a month, meaning that many have to take on second jobs or run smallholdings to cover their living costs. Given this chronically under-funded education systemthere is an urgent need to offer advanced skills training and resource packs to teachers in order to raise the level of morale and also to encourage teachers to talk to children about wider aspirations beyond their rural communities and consider the possibilities offered by tertiary education.\n\nEducational Capacity Building\n\nThis strategy envisages a more unified approach that builds on Ministry of Education objectives, to implement further training for curatorial staff and teachers so that they have the skills necessary to develop classes in a museum or other heritage context.\n\nFor some time Prof. Dr. David Lordkipanidze, Director of the GNM, has been searching for partners to help the GMN work with teachers and children from IDP backgrounds or living in the most remote parts of the country. His vision has been to inspire children from places such as the High Caucasus or the Azeri and Armenian minorities in the south to aspire to a career in the Humanities or the Natural Sciences with a view to them ultimately working as academics or curators. His methodology has been to organise summer camps and activity days for children, which is in line with the Ministry of Culture's Heritage 2025 strategy, that calls upon institutions like the GNM to take a leading role in offering skills development to teachers and engage with the most economically marginalised members of society. \n\nThis research proposes to utilise the approach favoured by the Director of the GNM and institute a training network involving GNM junior curators and educational staff interacting with regional schoolteachers to promote museums and cultural heritage sites as inviting spaces for classes in which to teach children about the value of not only cultural heritage, but also the Humanities in general.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "The impact of this research will be widely felt across Georgia. As it says in the letter of support from the partner organisation, the Georgian National Museum (GNM) is answerable to the Georgian Ministry of Culture and since 2016 the GNM has drawn up its strategic aims and objectives in line with the official Cultural Strategy 2025 document. As the Director of the GNM says in his letter, awareness raising and education are the first strategic goal outlined in this policy document.\n\nIn 2005 the GNM set up their Department of Education with a view to engaging with schools, students, children's groups, the disabled and many other sectors of society who were perceived as lacking access to Cultural Heritage resources. Although this attempt to widen participation has been underpinned by practical steps such as offering reduced entrance charges to school groups and IDPs, widespread poverty and lack of access to transport has meant that these measures have thus far met with limited success. Therefore the proposed activities offer a new model by taking staff and resources out from the centre (Tbilisi) and offering training and children's activities in the regions. In this way it is hoped that this initiative will reach ethnic and religious minorities that for financial and cultural regions do not actively engage with the capital.\n\nThis process began with our pilot project in 2017, supported by &pound;5,000 of seed funding from the University of Exeter and underlined by a further grant of &pound;1,500 in 2018. Data gathered from the teachers who took part in training events in Tbilisi in 2017 revealed a strong demand for more sessions explaining how to plan lessons in a museum context and an appetite to be taught how to use local heritage sites in education. The 2,000 training handbooks that were printed as part of this pilot have now been distributed via the Ministry of Education across the country and the Department of Education at the GNM are monitoring how these are received by repients across the regions (these handbooks can also be downloaded free of charge from the GNM website at: http://museum.ge/index.php?lang_id=GEO&amp;sec_id=95).\n\nHaving consulted with the GNM we have identified the regional museums at Kvareli, Sighnaghi, Bolnisi (East Georgia), Kutaisi, Akhalkalaki and Mestia (West Georgia) as sites for future training events that offer coverage of some of the more remote and deprived areas of the country. By rolling out the training offered in Tbilisi in 2017 in these regions, in addition to continuing to offer events in Tbilisi, it is hoped that we can reach members of ethnic and religious minorities, Georgian minority groups such as the Svans and those working with IDPs by travelling to them, rather than expecting them to come to Tbilisi. In this way we can also customise the training to be more relevant to local resources so that teachers can learn to work with sites and museums near at hand.\n\nThe same rationale partly underpins the ideas for the children's summer camps, but in this case the sites identified for camps are near Tbilisi (Mtskheta and the Tbilisi Ethnographic Museum) or in eastern Georgia (Kvareli and Dmanisi). In these cases it is thought that the experience of children travelling from their home region to another area will add to the significance of the camp and therefore it is desirable to try and take children to a part of the country that is new to them.\n\nIn a country of less than 4 million that is currently facing a demographic crisis caused by falling birthrates, the ability to reach at least 300 teachers (50 in each of the 6 locations) and around 20-30 children on each camp will have a significant effect on heritage education across the entire country. The outcome of this work will then be tracked by the GNM and reported back to the Ministries of Culture and Education with a view to informing future government policy on Cultural Heritage and Education, meaning that this work will have national impact.", "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF", "text": "Archaeology", "percentage": 0}, {"id": "541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947", "text": "History", "percentage": 0}, {"id": "895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10", "text": "RCUK Programmes", "percentage": 0}, {"id": "972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69", "text": "Visual arts", "percentage": 0}]}, "researchTopics": {"researchTopic": [{"id": "F0BD15AF-D726-4525-A824-5C01385833D3", "text": "Ethnography & Anthropology", "percentage": 0}, {"id": "E9C9696C-19B5-4706-9861-F5E0F93A6092", "text": "Archaeology Of Human Origins", "percentage": 0}, {"id": "F59367AF-7012-441B-9AD6-B360A3DFA96B", "text": "Landscape & Environ.

Attempts to predict rainfall variability in Africa have been limited by our poor understanding of what controls past variability; for example characterising the influence of El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) on African hydrology. The warmer conditions of the early Pleistocene when the Walker Circulation and ENSO become established offer an analogue to future African climate variability. We propose to investigate these issues by utilising a unique annually laminated half a million year long speleothem deposit from South Africa - the Buffalo Cave flowstone. Building on our previous millennial scale record of African rainfall, we now propose to expand proxy resolution to annual for band thickness and decadal for stable isotopes. The program of annual band thickness counting and stable isotope measurement will generate a rainfall record of unprecedented length and temporal resolution, enabling us to investigate the controls on African rainfall variability at a range of timescales from inter-annual to orbital. The Buffalo Cave flowstone record covers the time period ca. 2.0-1.5 Ma, based on preliminary dating evidence, and crosses one of the most important climate transitions in the Tropics, the intensification of the Walker circulation between 1.8 and 1.7 Ma. We will thus be able to characterise changes in South African rainfall before, during and after the establishment of this fundamental feature of the modern climate system. It will allow us to understand the evolution of the ENSO system and the long term influence of the IOD.

We will address this problem by setting up an interest group to focus on this topic. Researchers at key UK institutions (including Cambridge, Liverpool John Moores, Liverpool University, Oxford, Sheffield, UCL, York and others) will be invited to partake in our networking activities. This will help to increase the profile of UK research within this academic discipline and ensure that it continues to thrive in the future.\n\n- We will set up a web-page for the general public to explain current thinking on the climatic context of human evolution.

"grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "NERC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Chemistry", "abstractText": "Directly dating mammal fossils older than the limit of radiocarbon dating (~50,000 years) is very challenging, and this has led to a research focus on the most recent past in forming our understanding of mammalian response to changing environments. However this narrow time window is extremely limiting if we aim to understand the effects of climate change on land-based organisms, or unpick our own evolutionary history. We are hard-pressed to pinpoint the major evolutionary drivers for African mammals, and to compare patterns across a large, diverse continent. This problem notably includes our own ancestors. The fundamental problem preventing the required comparisons is chronology, and specifically a method that can date fossils directly.\n \nOur project team has been developing and employing methods for dating using the breakdown of the original proteins trapped within fossils. Excitingly, we have just made a methodological breakthrough which enables amino acid (a protein breakdown product) dating to be undertaken on the small amounts of amino acids remaining in tooth enamel (a resistant crystalline material composed of calcium phosphate with small amounts of protein). Dating enamel has the enormous advantage of providing a direct date on mammal teeth (critical fossils of interest) and the new method now enables routine amino acid analysis, successfully dating UK material up to 3 million years in age. This technique is ripe for development to a range of mammalian species and additional geographic regions, potentially revolutionising our understanding of mammalian evolution (including humans) during the last few million years, and their response to environmental change, at the local and the global scale.\n\nThis proposal will address the three areas of technology development needed for this dating method to be used routinely, but the time frame it opens up (the last ~4 million years) will enable a significant shift in the range of research questions we can address. The three strands of technological advance proposed are: 1) a microfluidics (&quot;lab on a chip&quot;) approach, which will enable both a significant decrease in the physical sample size needed, as well as preparation / analyses to be undertaken outside specialist labs; 2) combining analysis and imaging of both the organic and inorganic fractions to understand their structure, function and any impact on the protein breakdown; and 3) using advanced chemical models to understand the breakdown reactions.\n\nWe will then apply these methods to two regions of Africa of particular evolutionary interest: east Africa (including the Rift Valley) and southern Africa (including the 'Cradle of Humankind'). Initially calibrating the dating approach on reliably dated material, we will then expand it to material that is currently of unknown age. The developed chronology will also enable models of human-environment interaction to be tested, providing a breakthrough in our understanding of our evolutionary past. \n\nThis project will therefore take the latest advances in dating and apply them to a region where the palaeoenvironmental record can help shape the understanding of the sensitivity of Africa's biota (plants and animals) to changes in temperature and rainfall patterns. Understanding large mammals' responses to environmental and climate change is critical for developing appropriate conservation measures, and we will also gain insights into the timings and drivers of the evolution of our human lineage.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "This project will develop and apply a dating method using microfluidic technologies, reducing sample sizes and widening its applicability, democratising the technology by reducing the resource requirements for effective analysis. The development of a better dated palaeo-record has the potential to improve our understanding of our past evolution (and thus better contextualise our ancestry and heritage), as well as providing data on past climate and any faunal impact.\n\nThe key non-academic beneficiaries of this project are therefore:\n\nFuture generations of researchers and interested lay people: Currently, direct dating of mammalian fossils requires sample sizes &gt; 15 mg, which for the most important specimens can cause significant damage or restrict the use of such techniques, thus limiting the sample's scientific value. Reducing the amount of sample needed for analysis using microfluidic technologies will improve long term preservation of material for future generations, while also developing the knowledge base from which they can learn.\n\nSocioeconomically disadvantaged groups in Africa: The collaborative approach of this research aims to use the technologies developed over the course of this project to teach students and staff from socioeconomically disadvantaged groups in Africa, promoting the relationships between regional institutions and local communities concerned with local heritage enhancement and protection (e.g. the South African Heritage Resources Agency (SAHRA)). This will enable members of these communities to engage more deeply with the projects that use samples collected from their locations, both empowering them and potentially providing useful skills improving future employment prospects in this field. \n\nMuseum and festival visitors (UK &amp; Africa): The project team has collaborations with museums in Yorkshire, London and Cape Town, and will develop events and activities to engage visitors at these institutions. Where new evidence emerges using this approach, presentation of this new material challenging existing theories will also be included. This will increase visitors' knowledge of the history of the Quaternary and aid their understanding of the heritage of humans and other species throughout this period. Potential future exhibitions could also focus on the technology itself, leading to increased interest in the ways in which science can support archaeology and history. The research's relevance to understanding climate is a key area where increasing public understanding is essential. The team has extensive experience in developing science festival outreach events and activities, including workshops, public lectures and hands-on family events.\n\nScience education (UK &amp; Africa): Engaging school students in science by showing them the application of science in understanding our past (archaeological, evolutionary and climate) can be a revelation; they have often not seen this type of more unusual application of science, and can more easily relate it to their lives and interests. We will develop our work with the Education department at York focused on teacher-training, using the application of science to the study of our past to engage PGCE students and schools. This will build science capacity, especially in Africa.\n\nGovernments / NGOs developing conservation strategies: models used to predict our current/future climate and ecology rely on our understanding of the past. The insight into past mammal response to changing environmental conditions will help inform conservation strategies, taking account of the widest possible range of factors and influences.\n\nHealth sector and other commercial organisations: the developments made in microfluidic technology could have relevance to industry; analysis of biological molecules in low concentrations from complex mixtures is a highly active area for commercial development, particularly in development of analytics for continuous biomanufacturing.", "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF", "text": "Archaeology", "percentage": 40}, {"id": "EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0", "text": "Climate & Climate Change", "percentage": 20}, {"id": "6E910789-6B8D-4B73-B5B0-F3156942B558", "text": "Geosciences", "percentage": 20}, {"id": "863FC58A-7217-42EA-B076-663F2D770BB8", "text": "Chemical measurement", "percentage": 20}]}, "researchTopics": {"researchTopic": [{"id": "E9C9696C-19B5-4706-9861-F5E0F93A6092", "text": "Archaeology Of Human Origins", "percentage": 20}, {"id": "E32742C9-DE22-4776-82B4-444177FA03AD", "text": "Quaternary Science", "percentage": 20}, {"id": "7DCAF586-72E2-4881-9251-E72F38AF1CA4", "text": "Palaeoenvironments", "percentage": 20}, {"id": "98EA7556-1427-44F9-84F3-BF99B7207302", "text": "Analytical Science", "percentage": 20}, {"id": "59A2A0A2-345A-4E14-85F6-936CA1B268C4", "text": "Science-Based Archaeology", "percentage": 20}]}, "rcukProgrammes": {"rcukProgramme": []}, "start": null, "end": null, "participantValues": null}]}
