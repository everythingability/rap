Full iconographic details of the mosaics are provided and it is well illustrated with plates, figures, plans and maps. \\nIn the context of progress both within Crete and within Roman studies in general, particularly in light of the application of globalization theory, it is clear that a diachronic analysis of the island from a range of perspectives (local and centre) is needed in order to reverse the 'creeping determinism' that has propagated the idea of Roman and Late Antique Crete as a provincial dead end. As such it is apparent that a study of mosaics can provide an alternative means of assessing the nature of Crete within the context of the Empire. \\nThe introduction provides the Cretan context; a brief summary establishes the historical framework, building on that already detailed in Sanders' 1982 publication. The overview of the topography of the island allows the reader to become familiar with the landscapes of Crete and the reasons why such multiplicity of consequences to inclusion in the Empire could exist. Discussions of issues of terminology are presented and an overview of the application of globalization theory to Roman studies shows how pertinent the application is in achieving a realistic understanding of the diversity of Roman and Late Antique Crete. This allows the methodological aims to be clear. \\nThe catalogue of mosaics is included in the main text as the primary research material. Full iconographic, chronological, contextual and publication details are given and as such the corpus will fill a void in Mediterranean mosaic studies to date. Chapters 3 to 4 present the iconographic and contextual analysis of the mosaics, including the mosaics while Chapters 5 to 7 focus on the application of the evidence to building a new interpretation (function of space, craftspeople and broader context). An analysis of the date, distribution and iconography of mosaics will show that the fluctuating styles, locations and density of mosaics indicate subtle changes in the nature of society of Roman Crete as she grew into her position in the Eastern Roman Empire. Diversity between cities, between the urban and rural landscapes and over time are reflected in the analysis of mosaics; differences in occupations of cities in the 1st century, increasing communication with the Eastern Empire in the 2nd century and shift in focus from the south to the north in the 3rd century is reflected in mosaics. The lack of scholarly discussion on Late Antique Crete has lead to false perceptions of a society in decline from the 4th century. The inclusion of the Late Antique mosaics will emphasis the importance of the island during the period and show contrary to common belief, that the island was not only booming but the evidence of itinerant mosaicists suggests that she played a pivotal role in the communication network of the Eastern Empire.\\nFinally, having explored the evidence of the mosaics in detail with perceptions of globalization in mind, it is possible to approach the study of Crete from a different perspective to the norm; the variety in mosaics will show that while Crete was an important economic part of the Empire but that there were areas, such as Knossos, that had a strong desire to maintain the cultural identity within. Furthermore, by placing the material culture in the Mediterranean context, it will be clear that cultural developments in Crete can be viewed as relative to Rome and the Empire, rather than falling under a subsuming process of Roman acculturation. The resulting diachronic study from Hellenistic to Late Antique will present a much needed insight into the transformations with Cretan society, both urban and rural when the island becomes part of the Roman Empire.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": null, "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF", "text": "Archaeology", "percentage": 0}]}, "researchTopics": {"researchTopic": [{"id": "48433216-63E8-4CF1-9DCA-EB8E156B6265", "text": "Archaeology of Literate Soc.", "percentage": 0}]}, "rcukProgrammes": {"rcukProgramme": []}, "start": null, "end": null, "participantValues": null}, {"links": {"link": [{"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/568A239A-0E42-4499-932E-EE8878B02ED1", "rel": "PI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/C842A34F-18F7-454D-A259-FED802368496", "rel": "LEAD_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/funds/313E9EE9-83C0-472A-889A-FE91829EEC07", "rel": "FUND", "start": 1169424000000, "end": 1179702000000, "otherAttributes": {}}]}, "ext": null, "id": "A2C73C87-B489-4833-8565-FA84BD58B15F", "outcomeid": null, "href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/projects/A2C73C87-B489-4833-8565-FA84BD58B15F", "created": 1582643293000, "updated": null, "identifiers": {"identifier": [{"value": "AH/E504280/1", "type": "RCUK"}]}, "title": "Rome and the Sword: rethinking the role of martial violence in the Roman era", "status": "Closed", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Sch of Archaeology and Ancient History", "abstractText": "The projected book, Rome &amp; the Sword, will present a radically new understanding of Rome's military aspect. The empire was created and sustained by the violence of soldiers, yet this is often glossed over by those who celebrate the benefits of Roman imperialism, Equally, the realities of the sword are commonly sanitised by military specialists, who tend to focus either on the intricacies of unit organization and frontier systems, or think in idealised terms of 'The Roman Army: war machine', Here the military tends to be treated as a shiny mechanism in a glass box, effectively isolated both from wider Roman society, and even from its antagonists. \nRome and the Sword seeks to address these shortcomings, initially by foregrounding the sword itself, The book will examine weapons, what they did to people, how, by whom they were wielded, why, and with what wider consequences, Material evidence will be prominent, including skeletal trauma, In contrast to much modern warfare, martial violence was highly personal, comprising face-to-face acts of muscle-powered physical mayhem, Outcomes of conflicts were cumulative consequences of such intimate lethal encounters, To deepen our understanding of what soldiers did-and how they could do it-the book will draw on disciplines ranging from archaeology and ancient history to military history, anthropology, military psychology and sociology to help us understand the mentalities of soldiers and warriors. \nIt will also rethink our conceptual framework for dealing with the sword, For example, the wars which carved out the Roman empire cost millions of lives, yet they accounted for only part of the violence meted out by soldiers, Equally significant was 'internal' action: armed oppression of civilians and suppression of resistance, 'Warfare' fails to encompass, all these grim activities; 'martial violence' is a better term for what soldiers were about. \nCentrally, the book attacks the profoundly misleading notion of 'The Roman Army: war machine', Baldly, 'The Roman Army' did not exist: Romans themselves lacked a term equivalent to this modern phrase, because no such monolithic institution existed, They spoke instead of multiple armies, of regiments and, tellingly, of millets, 'the soldiers', Martial violence was dealt not by unthinking cogs, but by men for whom issues of emotion, morale, motivation and ambition were all-important. Soldiers cannot be understood in isolation, but only in the context of their interactions with particular antagonists, and as part of wider Roman society.\nThe soldiers were also in constant interaction with the warriors of neighbouring societies, in conflict but also through recruitment and mutual imitation, Armed men either side of the frontiers constantly reforged each other's identities in war and alliance; we cannot understand Roman soldiers without considering Gauls and Pannonians, Germans and Parthians. \nConsidering the Roman military in Roman rather than modern terms reveals another fundamental truth about 'the soldiers', rendered invisible when they are regarded as cogs in a war-machine, They were often as dangerous to other Romans, not least their own commanders, as to foreign enemies, Rome's famous military discipline was startlingly limited; highly trained, highly motivated and proud, Roman soldiers were also unruly, sometimes murderously mutinous, Their commanders struggled to control them, by rhetoric and persuasion, ritual and bribery, as much as by fear of punishment. \nRome &amp; the Sword will put the brutality of Roman power back on the agenda-but it will also put it into historical context and seek to reassess its role in Roman civilization, It will explore the implications of martial violence, from the chaos, misery and destruction it left in its wake to its paradoxical constructive and constitutive aspects, For the sword was not simply destructive; it was also central to the creation, definition and maintenance of Roman and other identities.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": null, "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects":

"leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "History and Cultures", "abstractText": "The need for mediaeval states to collect and distribute resources to maintain armies affected all aspects of political organisation and at critical times, when armies failed, could prove disastrous to society as a whole. Despite this, military studies seldom progress past existing texts to bear out the pragmatic consequences of military behaviour, even though military activity in terms of resource allocation and consumption is decisive in shaping pre-modern societies.\\n\\nThe objective of this project is to design a GRID-based framework to address these challenges focussing on the logistical context of the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. Manzikert is a key historic event in Byzantine history. The defeat of the Byzantine army by the Seljuk Turks, and the following civil war, resulted in the collapse of Byzantine power in central Anatolia. An event so traumatic that it became known as 'The dreadful day'. Given the key position this event takes within the collapse of Byzantine power, the lack of consensus between historians on the numbers of men involved at, or even the route taken by the Byzantine Army to, Manzikert is profound. The absence of new historical data to resolve these issues demands a dramatically different approach to the problem. This project proposes the implementation of a detailed modelling project which has the ability to break the current cycle of academic claim and counter-claim.\\n\\nThe issues surrounding the study of military logistics have been considered at a series of Birmingham/Princeton Military Logistics group workshops. These concluded that the processes of military logistical processes are amenable to computer-based modelling but that the complexities of the subject demand the use of agent-based modelling and large scale distributed simulation. GRID technologies, often used for contemporary logistics problems, occupy a strategic position for such research, permitting the resolution of complex problems through distributed simultaneous computing environments. The general applicability of such technologies support development of methodologies for multiple simulations to explore the nature of military dispositions and implications of choice in respect of the logistical context of Manzikert. They also generate re-useable resources and tools that can be applied to similar studies investigating warfare or logistics in other regions or periods.\\n\\nThe project benefits from an extensive digital environmental and historic database collated at Birmingham for the route of the battle and Anatolia more generally. Created as part of the work of the Birmingham/Princeton logistics group, this data can be used to create a GRID-enabled environmental model which can be populated by objects representing army groups and units or even soldiers, commanders or even pack animals. Individual models can be coded with behavioural and cognitive rules and be reused multiply. The composition of forces can be regulated and the ability of a range of forces to move successfully across a number of modelled routes between Constantinople and Manzikert can be assessed. The likelihood of the forces successfully reaching the battlefield and the condition of the army, in nutritional terms, following the march, can then be assessed and compared to evidence or assertions within primary and secondary sources on the composition of forces, the routes followed and the condition of the combatants prior to battle. In doing so the project will provide a fundamental re-assessment of the campaign and the critical logistical decisions leading up to the disastrous battle.\\n\\nThe project has clear research questions, using digital, methods and tools that are novel to historical studies. It will provide an exemplar demonstrating the value of large-scale simulation for historic research and the GRID as an instrument that enables academics to build common, distributed synthetic environments in supprt of historical studies more widely.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": null, "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF", "text": "Archaeology", "percentage": 0}]}, "researchTopics": {"researchTopic": [{"id": "48433216-63E8-4CF1-9DCA-EB8E156B6265", "text": "Archaeology of Literate Soc.", "percentage": 0}]}, "rcukProgrammes": {"rcukProgramme": []}, "start": null, "end": null, "participantValues": null}, {"links": {"link": [{"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/B3E1DBF1-338D-4462-A7B8-415CB7AD7A64", "rel": "PI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/818CD6C9-61EE-41F2-9F37-0C7A8F43E25D", "rel": "LEAD_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/funds/41171B2F-2315-4E71-A8D5-CCF0EB433DED", "rel": "FUND", "start": 1200182400000, "end": 1210546800000, "otherAttributes": {}}]}, "ext": null, "id": "D745969A-8562-4CB5-9C27-38A90E413D1A", "outcomeid": null, "href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/projects/D745969A-8562-4CB5-9C27-38A90E413D1A", "created": 1582643293000, "updated": null, "identifiers": {"identifier": [{"value": "AH/F004591/1", "type": "RCUK"}]}, "title": "Death and Religion in Archaic Greek Sicily", "status": "Closed", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "History and Cultures", "abstractText": "In the 8th and 7th centuries BC, groups of ancient Greeks left Greece to found settlements in Sicily. They proceeded to create some of the most prosperous and powerful states in the ancient Mediterranean world. Yet history of these settlements, at least before the fifth century BC, is poorly understood: literary references at best provide only a skeletal version of the political history of archaic Sicily (8th- 6th centuries) and its social history remains obscured. How did these settlements develop from small foundations to the mighty states of the fifth century? At what stage did their societies crystallise into different social classes and aristocracies? What was their relationship with the Greek 'homeland'? Were their populations made up purely of Greeks or did they co-reside with the indigenous Sikel population? \\n\\nGiven the paucity of literary accounts, the key to answering these questions and understanding the nature of archaic Sicilian Greek society lies in the archaeological record. Yet past studies of Sicily have made only limited use of this record. Often driven by modern imperialist models which identify similarity and ignore difference, they have viewed the politically independent Sicilian Greek states as inferior, unchanging, culturally dependent on their mother-cities in Greece and as purely Greek, apart from a Sikel slave class. Nostalgic links, it is argued, were maintained through duplicated customs and shared religious festivals.\\n\\nEssentially, the archaeological record means the burial record: major Greek sites have yielded thousands of graves over more than a century of excavation, while other archaeological contexts (sanctuaries, habitation areas) have produced limited resources. This project aims to understand the archaic Greek settlements of Sicily through their under-utilised funerary evidence. The emergence of a significant body of archaeological mortuary theory in the later twentieth century now enables the graves and their goods to be used to their full potential to examine the social dynamics of the living population.\\n\\nThis project analyses an extremely large body of data within the framework of these interpretative models. It assesses the extent to which the 'colonies' really did duplicate the customs of their 'mother-cites' and argues that they show considerable independence. The emergence of an aristocratic class by the late seventh century is identified through increasing grave wealth and there is evidence for accelerating competition in funerary display both within and between individual states in the sixth. The usefulness of the funerary record for observing different ethnic elements in the population (especially through intermarriage) is investigated and different strategies for the assertion of ethnic and cultural identities through choice of interment method and grave goods are identified. This project observes periods when the high mortality rate of young children is grossly under-represented and explores the possibility of deliberate exclusion on grounds of social rank. Topographic study indicates that conspicuous grave position and grave plotting was critical to the assertion of social status. Comparisons with sanctuary evidence indicate that votive dedications and temple building also reflect competing social groups and the assertion of new cultural identities. \\n\\nThis research argues that the archaeological evidence points to a very different view of archaic Greek Sicily from that which has been postulated in the past: rather than being inferior and culturally dependent, these states used material culture to assert new, independent ethnic and cultural identities; they underwent rapid social change over a period of c. 200 years; and they employed their material culture and visual media to assert their status as major players in the ancient world. \\n", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": null, "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities":

"Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Archaeology", "abstractText": "The conversion of the pagan Anglo-Saxons to Christianity was spearheaded by the spread of monastic culture across England between the 7th to 9th centuries AD when a series of emergent kingdoms began to exploit the new faith as an ideological weapon in the war for political supremacy. This process laid down a new tier of monastic settlements more complex in physical, social and economic organisation than traditional forms of habitation found in the Anglo-Saxon countryside. In the absence of detailed descriptions in contemporary historical sources, only archaeology can provide an informed impression of how that complexity was given physical expression in the layout and material practices of Anglo-Saxon monastic institutions. Potential of this kind has been tested by recent archaeological work at Northumbrian institutions such as Hartlepool and Hoddom where there have been opportunities to glimpse craft activity, domestic occupation and satellite cemeteries at a considerable distance from the core monastic buildings. Although the importance of these peripheral zones is now firmly established, our conception of how they relate to the totality of a monastic landscapes remains poorly defined owing to the small scale of the excavations and the poor preservation associated with the outer precincts of documented monasteries.\n\nThis project will redress this imbalance through the detailed archaeological examination of Lyminge, Kent, the site of a documented double monastery (a mixed-sex community presided over by a royal abbess) founded in the 7th century. The site was evaluated systematically by geophysical survey and trial excavation between 2008 and 2010. This work demonstrated that Lyminge has excellent horizontal preservation covering an extensive swathe of the outer precincts of the monastic settlement, combined with an unbroken vertical sequence spanning both monastic-phase occupation and a settlement precursor of the 5th-7th centuries AD. As such, the project has potential to answer a suite of questions on the process of monastic foundation in the kingdom of Kent, a region crucial to the earliest stages of the Anglo-Saxon conversion. The proposed excavation will exploit Lyminge's potential to pioneer a new emphasis on the antecedents of monasticism in early Anglo-Saxon England, and develop an archaeological framework for elucidating the double monastery as a distinctive institutional expression of the fledgling English church.\n\nThe major activity of the research will be a programme of excavation on the village green over three summer field seasons (2012-14). The project will also re-analyze previous work in the churchyard where core buildings, including an Anglo-Saxon church, were first brought to light by Antiquarian excavations in the mid 19th century. An Integrated Archaeological Data-Base will be used to facilitate the development of the project website, archive and publications. Some post-excavation such as radiocarbon dating will be completed to enable a complete understanding of stratigraphy and site development and to inform the full analysis of artefactual and ecofactual assemblages. The main academic outputs will be an edited volume designed to set Lyminge in its international context, accompanied by articles in peer-reviewed journals. Phase 2 of this project (for which future funding will be sought in 2015) will complete full, integrated analysis of archaeological data-sets for final publication.\n\nThe project will collaborate with the Kent Archaeological Society and the Canterbury Archaeological Trust to pool expertise and also to help deliver a comprehensive programme of public outreach and participation targeting Lyminge, neighbouring communities and Kent at large. Through such means, this project will make Lyminge's heritage better understood to its own residents and enhance public understanding of Kent's formative role in the development of Anglo-Saxon monastic culture.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "1.

The project will also benefit governmental and local authorities by providing a direct feed of data into Historical Environment Records (HERs), Local Development Frameworks, Parish and Conservation Management Plans to enhance the protection, management and promotion of Lyminge's archaeological heritage. \n\nCanterbury Archaeological Trust, in its capacity as the main archaeological contractor in Kent, will benefit from opportunities to adopt, through knowledge transfer, scientific methodologies used on the project, to collaborate in academic research examining a seminal, yet ill-understood era in Kent's history, to meet its strategic aim to promote advancement of public education in archaeology, and to improve its approach to the excavation and interpretation of cognate sites encountered in future projects.\n\nThe research will enhance the interpretation and public presentation of other early ecclesiastical sites represented in the region including: the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Canterbury Christ Church Cathedral, St Augustine's Abbey and St Martin's church; Reculver, Rochester; Dover; and Minster-in-Sheppey. Local and national museums will benefit from the input of new material and interpretations to enhance their exhibitions.\n\nProject partners, the Kent Archaeological Society, along with other regional volunteer groups, will benefit from the opportunity to engage their members in an agenda-setting research excavation. Knowledge transfer will answer the Society's need for specialist training to create in-house expertise in such techniques as environmental sampling, which it can deploy on future projects. Additionally, the project's educational and outreach programme will help the Society to deliver its stated aim to stimulate the interest of young people through promoting the study of archaeology in schools. \n\nSchools will benefit from a variety of experiential learning environments both on-site and in the classroom tailored to the enhancement of teaching across disciplines at all levels of the curriculum; A-level students will gain valuable archaeological experience and generic skills in preparation for Higher education or the workplace; the project will promote lifelong learning through the participation of undergraduate students enrolled on Kent's part-time degree programme, volunteers and members of the public.\n\nThe project's inclusive ethos, combined with opportunities for public participation in a wide range of activities embracing varying interests and capabilities, will promote social cohesion, health and wellbeing within Lyminge and neighbouring communities.

The series sought to create 'concentrated volumes out of a personal space that carries the memory of an absent self' (Gormley [1997] 2007). This is achieved in part through intimate measurements of physical bodies and in part through the distribution of these personal and monumentally public forms within buildings and landscapes. My project is inspired by and can be compared to his work in its examination of interconnections of architecture and self through sacred space and landscape in ancient Egypt. \\n\\nThroughout ancient Egyptian history, elite individuals commissioned significant monuments in order to celebrate and commemorate their lives and to ensure that their memory would endure and they would make a successful transition to the next world. These monuments included inscribed stone statues and stelae dedicated in temples as well as decorated tomb chapels. Although the majority of the monuments bore formulaic, standardized texts and images, in all periods smaller numbers thematized more personal, subjective components of self and biography. Even though these self-presentations are one of the most characteristic features of Egyptian high culture, they have rarely been analysed in context and in detail. Yet they offer a unique opportunity to examine the ways in which individuals fashioned distinctive selves for display and the significance of the physical and social contexts they selected.\\n\\nI focus on the late New Kingdom, Dynasties 19 and 20 (ca.1290-1075 BCE), a period of marked development in language, art, and religious expression, partly in response to the revolutionary changes during the reign of the 'heretic king', Akhenaten. This is a time when individuals' choices can be seen as particularly salient and highly charged. Through case-studies, I address how and why people made their selections for display and the significance of those selections for the transformation of high culture. The case-studies look at the setting of monuments in specific landscapes and architectural spaces, such as the temple and cemetery landscape of the West Bank at Thebes (modern Luxor) in Upper Egypt and the ritually charged setting of the sacred animal necropolis at Saqqara (near modern Cairo) in Lower Egypt. Locations like these provide clearly bounded contexts in which it is possible to compare different forms and motifs of self-presentation and to understand how elites both make use of different periods in the past and develop innovative forms. \\n\\nMy research develops new approaches to the interpretation of a broad range of elite materials from ancient Egypt, emphasizing the salience of landscapes and personal and group selection and engagement. Through its integrative, holistic method which encompasses built environments, media, images, and texts, this study will inform understanding of New Kingdom history and culture and highlight the extraordinary eloquence of the Egyptian sources for scholars of other ancient and pre-modern societies.\\n", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": null, "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF", "text": "Archaeology", "percentage": 0}]}, "researchTopics": {"researchTopic": [{"id": "48433216-63E8-4CF1-9DCA-EB8E156B6265", "text": "Archaeology of Literate Soc.", "percentage": 0}]}, "rcukProgrammes": {"rcukProgramme": []}, "start": null, "end": null, "participantValues": null}, {"links": {"link": [{"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/90053DD5-888C-4FE6-A2C5-A7334FACC31C", "rel": "PI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/818CD6C9-61EE-41F2-9F37-0C7A8F43E25D", "rel": "LEAD_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/funds/729A5B8E-E7D4-4895-A39C-DA22CDF1D196", "rel": "FUND", "start": 1168646400000, "end": 1178924400000, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/9CE17D9D-6DD7-45E9-AE0D-368831126B1F", "rel": "PUBLICATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}]}, "ext": null, "id": "46AF7A0C-D385-4464-B40E-245A76782FC6", "outcomeid": null, "href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/projects/46AF7A0C-D385-4464-B40E-245A76782FC6", "created": 1582643293000, "updated": null, "identifiers": {"identifier": [{"value": "AH/E504167/1", "type": "RCUK"}]}, "title": "Refashioning the World: an archaeology of the Roman West AD 200-500", "status": "Closed", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "History and Cultures", "abstractText": "The period A.D.200-500 sees some of the most fundamental and important changes in the creation of Europe. On the one hand there is the political and military collapse of the western part of the Roman Empire and its replacement by smaller kingdoms ruled by kings and aristocracies of Germanic descent, sometimes giving rise to modern nations such as France. On the other hand this is the period in which Christianity became the dominant religion, and it was Christianised late Roman culture, language and law that were taken over by the new kingdoms, to lie at the core of medieval and later Europe. Our picture of this period is one drawn largely from written sources, which give us the classic image of a period of 'decline and fall'. But it is not as simple as that.\n\nAlongside the written texts, we now have a large and growing body of archaeological evidence. This has all too often been used to supplement and confirm the historical narrative, rather than being used in its own right to tell its own story. What this project aims to do is to gather and use that evidence to create a new, distinct story of the period; one which may or may not agree with what we thought we knew. It will look at the area from the Rhine to the Straits of Gibraltar and examine the evidence for the settlements in which people lived and what they tell us about their society and values; the places in which they practised their religions, pagan and Christian; where and how they were buried; the objects they made and used; the crops and herds they raised; the amount of contact and commerce they had with each other; and how all these changed over these crucial three centuries.\n\nTo take some examples. In place of the large, undefended, lavish towns of the second century, we find much smaller, heavily fortified towns with the new Christian churches. Historically this is seen as part of 'decline and fall', but archaeologically could it be seen as the creation of a new, militarised and Christian city and citizen? Many burials of this period contain objects thought to be of Germanic origin, and thus attesting to the barbarian invaders who brought the western empire to its knees. There is evidence, though, that we are looking at 'barbarian chic'. The new, militarised nobility aping the dress of the warriors they feared? By contrast, in other regions the nobility clings to the old expressions of power, grand country houses, mosaics, lavish decor. Why should there be these contrasts?\n\nClearly, the archaeology has a series of different stories to tell us depending on the type of evidence and how we interpret, on the time and on the place at which we are looking.

These precious metals underpinned the emergence of early medieval kingdoms in Europe by providing the raw materials for prestige objects that were used to create, contest and reflect status within and between societies. While parts of Europe favoured gold, in Scotland silver was the most important precious metal for over 600 years (AD400-1000). Silver had been introduced to Scotland by Rome (via subsidies, military pay, diplomacy and loot) and rapidly became a vital means of expressing power and prestige in the lands beyond the frontier, albeit one that carried Imperial 'baggage'. Recent discoveries of Late Roman and Early Medieval silver hoards in Scotland, and re-evaluation of existing hoards, has highlighted the need to connect with those working on comparable material elsewhere in Europe. The network Silver, Status and Society will provide an opportunity to maximise the momentum building from two existing programmes of national research on silver to develop, for the first time, a comparative international and cross-disciplinary study of this powerful and valuable material, during this pivotal period in Europe's history. \n\nSilver provides a key source of evidence for understanding reactions to the political vacuum caused by the disintegration of the Roman Empire and the emergence of the early medieval kingdoms of Europe, but research has been inhibited by national boundaries and divides between academic disciplines. Bringing together academics, museum professionals, early career researchers and doctoral students, will create lasting cross-disciplinary connections between those involved in the discovery, curation, research and public presentation of early medieval silver from across northern Europe. The network will place an emerging field of study in the UK into an international context by providing insights into comparable material, alternative methodologies, and interpretative models. This will provide a platform from which to compare and contrast different strategies towards the supply, circulation and use of silver following the collapse of the Roman Empire and to explore the role of this precious metal in the emergence of the early medieval kingdoms of Europe. \n\nThe findings of the Silver, Status and Society network will be disseminated publically through an open day conference in Edinburgh, and via the existing public programmes activity of the Glenmorangie Research Project on Early Medieval Scotland (based at National Museums Scotland www.nms.ac.uk/earlymedieval), including a special exhibition in Edinburgh and publication of a popular book in 2017. Academic dissemination will be through two symposia, one in the UK and one in Denmark, and the publication of a volume of papers drawn from them.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "It is anticipated that the main beneficiaries of this research will be the wider public and Third Sector museums and galleries. Additional impact will be generated by showcasing on an international stage a successful UK business-arts collaboration, and for policy makers through consideration of methods of protection and management of a fragile and vulnerable archaeological resource.\n\nThe main impact of this Network will be in raising awareness of an important aspect of our shared cultural heritage: the emergence of the early medieval kingdoms of northern Europe and the particular role played by silver in expressing connections to the wider world as well as more local concerns. The network will enrich cultural life of UK and international public visiting UK (and northern Europe participating museums) by effectively communicating results of new approaches to a vital period of Europe's past. In part, this will be achieved by a public day conference following the second symposia, planned for Edinburgh in Autumn/Winter 2017 which will disseminate the network's findings to a popular audience. In addition, National Museums Scotland is committed to incorporate the network's findings into a temporary exhibition and popular publication on silver AD300-800 in 2017, as well as to disseminating widely via volunteer guides and a programme of public lectures and digital content. This will showcase UK collections in their wider context, both valuable and of interest to local (Scottish/UK) and international visitors. \n\nThe network will have valuable impact in the Third sector by enabling NMS and other participating museums to foster connections with researchers in 'traditional' academic sector and other IROs, particularly those based outside of the UK. These connections are vital to functioning of museums, with tangible benefits in building collaborations that lead to the development of joint exhibitions, reciprocal loans, and other research funding applications. \n\nThe network will also have impact for policy makers through facilitation of discussion of protection and management strategies for precious-metals stray finds. The material culture at the heart of this network includes some very valuable and at-risk archaeological remains and modern discoveries of silver from the first millennium AD have tended to be a result of metal detecting activity. The discovery of over 100 pieces of hacksilver material by the PI during fieldwork investigation of an old find-spot at Gaulcross raises interesting questions for the protection of sites already in the public consciousness but unprotected by legislation. This network presents an opportunity for comparison of methods of protection and management of precious metal stray finds adopted elsewhere in Europe and to reflect on best practice for the various legal systems protecting and governing the treatment of material culture in the UK. \n\nThis application is made in the context of a 9-year research project funded by a partnership between National Museums Scotland and The Glenmorangie Company. The innovative nature of the partnership has been recognised by an Arts &amp; Business award and a motion tabled by the Scottish Parliament. The network will provide an additional benefit by promoting this model as a means of supporting sustained programmes of academic research.", "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []},

Culture", "status": "Closed", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Sch of European Culture and Languages", "abstractText": "The research project will be the first in-depth study of the society and culture of Roman and Late Antique Egypt that uses everyday artefacts as its principal source of evidence. In this way it will transform our understanding of social experience and social relations in Roman and Late Antique Egypt. \n\nUK museums hold significant collections of artefacts from Roman and Late Antique Egypt (c. 30 B.C. to A.D. 700) as a result of archaeological excavations carried out in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Yet because scholarly interest has focused on the Egypt of the Pharaohs, and on evidence about Egypt from ancient texts, most of these objects have never been studied. This situation is likely to continue, since most UK museums and universities do not have any specialists with relevant expertise.\n \nWe will focus on the collection of UCL's Petrie Museum, one of the largest and best-documented in the UK, designated by the UK govt. in 1998 as of 'outstanding importance'. The collection contains more than 8000 objects dating to the periods under study, most of which have not been the subject of any research. Moreover, the collection includes many objects that rarely survive elsewhere, and so is very important in terms of our overall understanding of Roman artefacts across the empire. \n\nBy examining the features of artefacts, the materials they were made from, evidence of modification that shows how they were used in daily life, and associated texts that provide further information, we will investigate aspects of social behaviour and experience and shed new light on daily life in Roman and Late Antique Egypt. We are particularly interested in investigating how experiences may have differed among people with varying status in society (children, adults, people of different social class), which can be investigated by examining objects that can be associated with these particular groups. By examining aspects such as wear and repair, we will also investigate the personal and sentimental meanings that may have been attached to objects. The categories of objects that we will study will comprise ordinary everyday artefacts such as dress accessories, shoes, toys, simple musical instruments such as bells, clappers and rattles, and other domestic items. \n\nThe potential of the material to transform understanding is amply demonstrated through pilot studies of selected artefact categories from Roman and Late Antique Egypt (baskets, dice, reed pens, and feeding bottles) already undertaken by the investigators and researcher on the project. These studies show that the research value of Roman material culture from Egypt is immense, and that similar approaches to a much wider data-set of everyday artefacts are likely to yield extremely significant results.\n\nThe research will bring together specialists in the interpretation of ancient Egyptian texts, and archaeological artefacts, drawing on new methodologies and interpretative approaches including the experimental recreation of objects using new technologies. It will result in a co-authored book that will be a significant departure from extant previous studies of the social history of Roman and Late Antique Egypt in its focus on artefact evidence. Further outputs will include a journal article on the 3D scanning and recreation of objects, online teaching and research resources for schools and universities, a workshop for museums and academics, and a museum display at the Petrie Museum open to the general public.\n\nThe museum display will present our research on the simple musical instruments in particular, displaying the originals from the Petrie collection, prototypes &amp; replicas made via 3D scanning/printing technology (which may be handled and played by visitors), the sounds that can be made using the replica artefacts, and our interpretation of how the artefacts would have been used to create particular experiences, for instance in religious and ritual activities.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "In addition to academic beneficiares (see separate section) the following groups will benefit from the research project: Petrie Museum, other UK museums, UK schools and the wider general public, university students.\n\nPetrie Museum\nThe project will contribute to the Petrie Museum's documentation of objects through the new research on the collections. Additional information will be added to the museum's current online database of artefacts. Most of the objects in the database have not been the subject of any research, and the current information generally comprises only basic identifications. In some instances one record covers 50+ individual objects. The research project will transform our knowledge of many objects, and thus the quality and quantity of information available on the online database.\n\nThe project will also facilitate a new display on artefacts from Roman Egypt which will take place at the museum and address the remit of the museum to present its material to the wider public and encourage public engagement with research. Associated web materials will enhance the Petrie Museum web site. A number of replica objects will also be donated to the Petrie Museum for future use in educational and outreach activities. The museum will therefore benefit from considerable enhancement of its records, from the opportunity to showcase materials from Roman Egypt in its collections in an innovative museum display and from additional project-generated impact activities and materials.\n\nUK Schools and General Public\nSince Dynastic Egypt is dominant in public perceptions of the region, the general public has very little knowledge or understanding of Roman and Late Antique Egypt. The museum display and associated online materials that are part of the project will foster greater understanding and knowledge of the period and region, for instance illuminating similarities and differences with the wider Roman world, and enhancing understanding of the complex cultural interactions of the period. The museum display will also provide information that will educate visitors on the history of musical instruments and the diverse contexts in which music was used in the ancient world. Schools will additionally be provided with a Learning Resource Pack with material related to coverage of the Roman period and of Egyptian civilization at Key Stage 2. The project will thus directly bring benefits to schools teaching the national curriculum by providing appropriate teaching materials. \n\nUniversity Students\nStudents across the UK will benefit from resource materials available via the Petrie Museum's Digital Egypt pages, aimed at students in higher education, which can be used in their studies. The enhanced information on the Petrie Museum online database of artefacts will be also useful to undergraduate students researching their dissertations, and to research students as a resource for M.A. and PhD. level research, who will have access to more accurate and complete information than previously available.\n\nOther UK Museums\nUK museums with collections pertaining to Roman Egypt will benefit from the increased documentation of comparable material in the Petrie Museum online database, and from a workshop presenting project results and the innovative methodologies used for the study of Roman/Late Antique Egypt. The workshop and associated exhibition private view will encourage future museum displays on artefacts from Roman/Late Antique Egypt at other UK museums by setting out new approaches, making clear the value of UK Roman/Late Antique Egypt artefact collections, and transforming research information available on artefacts from the period and region.", "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []},

"leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Archaeology", "abstractText": "Glastonbury Abbey is crucial to understanding British monasticism, and it holds a special place in English popular culture. Thirty-four seasons of excavations took place between 1904 and 1979, but the results have remained unpublished. This project will analyse and publish the archive of excavations at Glastonbury Abbey by iconic figures in the history of archaeology: St John Hope (1904), Bligh Bond (1908-21), Peers and Clapham (1928-39) and Ralegh Radford (1951-64). The Trustees of Glastonbury Abbey are project partners and the results of the study will inform site interpretation and museum display.\\n\\nGlastonbury was one of the earliest monasteries in England, likely dating from the seventh century, and was reputedly the only one to have enjoyed continuous occupation to the sixteenth century. In 1191 the monks alleged that they had uncovered the graves of Arthur and Guinevere, and later they promoted a link with Joseph of Arimathea, claiming that he had founded the first church in AD 63. The Arthurian connection was developed after a devastating fire of 1184, when funds were needed to rebuild the Abbey. \\n\\nArchaeological excavations focused on the main claustral ranges and parts of the cemetery, and substantial assemblages were recovered of worked stone, window glass, pottery, ceramic tiles and small finds. The site's central importance to archaeological scholarship stems from the interim publication of a series of early medieval churches, a vallum enclosure, potentially the earliest cloister in Britain, and craft-working activities including unique glass furnaces. This project will analyse the archive records and excavated finds to consider key research questions. Is there evidence for occupation pre-dating the early monastery? What is the form and date of the early 'family' of churches and the first cloister? Can continuous occupation be demonstrated? What was the scale and extent of the early craft-working centre? Is it possible to reconstruct the zoning and land-use of the early monastery and the subsequent development of the medieval precinct? Can we reconstruct the architectural form, style and development of the later medieval abbey? Did the emphasis placed on myth and cult activities create a distinctive layout in the medieval church and cloister? \\n\\nAnalysis of the archive will be complemented by a new geophysical survey of the precinct. The geophysics will enhance interpretation of the cloister excavations and increase knowledge of the broader precinct. It will also facilitate the assessment of surviving buried deposits, contributing to their conservation and guiding future research. \\nThe full publication of the Glastonbury archive will achieve a major landmark in monastic archaeology. Beyond the intrinsic historical significance of the Abbey, the site is of demonstrated international importance in understanding early medieval glassworking, and for advancing understanding of the transition between the early and later medieval monastic plans. \\n\\nThe results of the project will be published as a monograph and will be accessible as an online database through the Archaeology Data Service. This project will present new findings on a site that is highly valued by the international academic audience, the local community and the multi-denominational community of visitors to the Abbey, numbering over 100,000 each year.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": null, "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF", "text": "Archaeology", "percentage": 0}]}, "researchTopics": {"researchTopic": [{"id": "48433216-63E8-4CF1-9DCA-EB8E156B6265", "text": "Archaeology of Literate Soc.", "percentage": 0}]}, "rcukProgrammes": {"rcukProgramme": []}, "start": null, "end": null, "participantValues": null}, {"links": {"link": [{"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/FC14C613-6BCB-46DB-84B7-6E9059B72E51", "rel": "PI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/C842A34F-18F7-454D-A259-FED802368496", "rel": "LEAD_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/funds/A5DC25AB-E1BC-42BC-8C48-A960549E4D7C", "rel": "FUND", "start": 1159657200000, "end": 1170201600000, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/keyfindings/65AACEE5-4AF5-44AE-BDA4-6A505E093469", "rel": "KEY_FINDING", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/F4E3080A-EAA5-4AD3-BCF5-1E9994FB67E5", "rel": "PUBLICATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/E716FD09-D797-42B8-BE8A-50E0C5EAF04F", "rel": "PUBLICATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/4163C99F-6C3F-4DBD-BC04-4CB8F2B934EF", "rel": "PUBLICATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}]}, "ext": null, "id": "F1E1FF10-99FA-4188-A445-5E31373DBEA4", "outcomeid": null, "href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/projects/F1E1FF10-99FA-4188-A445-5E31373DBEA4", "created": 1582643293000, "updated": null, "identifiers": {"identifier": [{"value": "AH/D500613/1", "type": "RCUK"}]}, "title": "Food Consumption in Roman Britain: Diversity and Change", "status": "Closed", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Sch of Archaeology and Ancient History", "abstractText": "This project aims to analyse the diet of people living in Britain during the Roman period (c. AD 43- 410). This period represents a time of major change in Britain: the Roman conquest resulted in the creation of military settlements, towns, a complex road system, specialised craft production, markets, long-distance trade, and the emergence of new social classes. In terms of food, it brought new consumers (people not involved in agricultural production), and new foods, such as grapes, figs, olives, peach, almond, coriander, cucumber, and black pepper, introduced from the Mediterranean region and beyond. What effect did these new developments have? Was this a period of major diversification and change in diet? Do the newly imported foods replace the traditional ones, or do the latter become consumed exclusively by certain groups of the population? Do the new consumers distinguish themselves from the rural community in terms of diet? Since many of the new foods were initially expensive, difficult to obtain and consequently only available to the elite, did they remain exclusive foods throughout the period or did their status change over time? Did any become commonly available and even locally cultivated?\n\nThe project concerns the analysis of the botanical food remains recovered from Roman period excavations in Britain, consisting of c. 550 published reports. The objective is to write three research papers, synthesizing and interpreting the available evidence for a non-specialist audience. One will represent an overall synthesis of the changes in the British diet over this period, evaluating both cultural and environmental factors influencing the choice of food and assessing the degree to which food helped create or enhance cultural identities. The second paper will focus on the dispersal histories of the exotic foods brought in and assess the degree of differential access to these foods. The third will evaluate the quality of the data currently available for this study, and highlight future research and methodological needs.\n\n\nFood is both a biological and social need for all human societies, and the roots of our current diet are located in history. This research will advance our understanding of the first major period of change in the British diet since the Neolithic. Moreover, as food is both a manifestation of social identity and a tool with which social identities and relations are created, maintained and enhanced, this study will also add to our knowledge of Romano-British society.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": null, "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF", "text": "Archaeology", "percentage": 0}]}, "researchTopics": {"researchTopic": [{"id": "48433216-63E8-4CF1-9DCA-EB8E156B6265", "text": "Archaeology of Literate Soc.", "percentage": 0}, {"id": "F59367AF-7012-441B-9AD6-B360A3DFA96B", "text": "Landscape & Environ.

"leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Asia", "abstractText": "Understanding China, home to one quarter of mankind, is vital to all citizens of the world. China's international role is of paramount importance to us all. To understand that role we need to investigate China's historical relationships with Africa, the Middle East, South, Southeast and East Asia. The most influential period of China's cultural interaction with the wider world was the early 15th century; hence it is this period that is the focus of our research project. By researching early Ming China's courts, their cultural, military and religious activities, and foreign interaction we can present a new history of this period. This history can then be the foundation for future research. Key to the presentation of this new history is an exhibition for 2014-2015 to be shown in the new World Conservation and Exhibitions Centre (currently under construction) at the British Museum. The exhibition 'Ming Courts and Contacts 1400-1450', a book, planned academic conference and edited volume will disseminate this research to a wide range of audiences.\n\nThis project is led by two Ming specialists, Jessica Harrison-Hall of the BM and Professor Craig Clunas of Oxford University and . An essential aspect of this new research will be to bring together a range of different researchers to explore the key questions at the heart of this project. For the exhibition key institutional partners will be museums, libraries and universities in Asia, North America and Europe e.g. Hubei Provincial Museum in Wuhan, Palace Museum, Beijing, and the National Palace Museum, Taipei. The research will draw on the expertise of scholars with backgrounds in archaeology, architecture, art-history, anthropology, economics and literary studies. The imperial court of China in the early Ming enjoyed an unprecedented range of contacts with other courts of Asia (the Timurids in Iran and Central Asia, the Ashikaga in Japan, Joseon Korea) but also with Bengal, with Sri Lanka, with Africa, and even with the heart of the Islamic world in Mecca. In addition to Clunas and Harrison-Hall key authors for the book are Lothar Ledderose Professor of the History of Art of Eastern Asia at the University of Heidelberg, Germany; David Robinson - Robert H.N. Ho Professor in Asian Studies, Professor of History Colgate University, USA; Marsha Haufler (Weidner) - Professor of Later Chinese Art, University of Kansas, USA; Timothy Brook, Professor of Chinese History at the University of British Columbia, Canada; and Yuan Wenqing of Hubei Provincial Museum.\n\nIn contemporary China 1400-1450 is popularly regarded as a golden age of international engagement and a model for modern China. This is demonstrated through contemporary material culture - films, postage stamps and advertising. Recent popular histories written for an English-reading audience have misinformed a general public about this period. This new research and the exhibition 'Ming Courts and Contacts 1400-1450' which will disseminate the findings will address this and present a new, well-researched history for academic and popular consumption.\n\nKey research questions are: \n1. To what extent Chinese culture and society of the period 1400-1450 was shaped by contacts with other cultures and societies of the time?\n2. What was the nature of that engagement - what did China appropriate from, and what did it contribute to, other cultures 1400-1450?\n3. To what extent was that engagement mediated through Chinese central and regional imperial courts, as key nodes of transnational or transcultural contact?\n4. What was the distinctive role of art and material culture in that engagement, and to what extent do they support or subvert the narratives derived from textual sources?\n5. How does that period of sustained transnational and transcultural contact affect current Chinese state and popular perceptions of China's role in the world ?", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "We are researching, writing and presenting a new interpretation for this period of history for Ming China 1400-1450. The three-year project of original reserach will result in a major, high-profile exhibition accompanied by a range of supporting activities. This will widen understanding of China's historic global role for diverse audiences within the UK and world-wide. There are clear social, cultural and economic benefits to understanding China and to having more students engaged with China's past as well as present. Combining investigators from the British Museum and Oxford University provides opportunities for approaching the subject in a rigorous academic way but with the dissemination of that information at the very heart of the investigations. This will expand knowledge and lead to a reinterpretation of many of the objects held internationally from this period. Promoting the understanding of China is a vital result of this research. \n\nThe exhibition Ming: Courts and Contacts 1400-1450 will run for 4 months during autumn 2014 and spring 2015 and will be supported by a large schools, community and public programme. Based on recent major British Museum and other London exhibitions, it will attract at least 150,000 visitors in London and sell at least 10,000 copies of the book with 1,000,000 visits to the supporting web materials including those for the British Museum's website in China. Numbers of adults and families attending talks, performances and other activities, such as weekend and holiday activities will be at least 30,000 and the ambitious schools and learning programme should reach at least 10,000. The exhibition will lead to considerable press coverage in this country and abroad, while supporting TV and radio programmes are being planned. Ways to extend the reach of the exhibition across the UK are being explored; a model of touring key objects to other UK Museums has been developed for previous major BM exhibitions. \n\nThis exhibition will be one of two in the inaugural year of the new World Conservation and Exhibitions Centre at the BM which remains on schedule for completion in late 2013. The show will be one of the last under the Directorship of Neil MacGregor, this - combined with the subject matter, will mean this will be a very high profile exhibition. The following have been identified as the key beneficiaries of this research, but there will be others: \n\n1. Academics and students worldwide \n2. Diverse adult and family audiences, reached through visiting the exhibition, attending parts of the supporting programme of activities, watching TV or listening to radio programmes produced to support the exhibition, visiting the web resources etc. \n3. Teachers and pupils in schools in London and South East England. \n4. The Museum's media partners for the exhibition\n\nEconomic Impact: This research will lead to a direct economic impact for the Museum and the London economy. The British Museum, a publicly funded institution, will benefit from the major commercial sponsorship that will be needed to pay for the exhibition, ticket sales and revenue generated in Museum shops and cafes from visitors, sales of publications and other merchandise. At a time of significantly reduced Government core funding to the Museum, this revenue underpins the delivery of the exhibition while any surplus supports the Museum's wider activities. British Museum exhibitions provide clear economic wider benefits for London through revenues generated by visits to the museum (transport, shops and hotels) by visitors, many of whom come from outside London (at least 45,000) or from Europe (at least 30,000). \n\nInternational impact: Major exhibitions play an important role in UK cultural diplomacy, supporting existing Governmental and cultural institutional relations, and acting as a base for promoting further cultural and economic links.

The overwhelming majority of studies on Roman art focus on the products of Rome, Italy, and the Mediterranean area. There is a tendency to marginalize the many thousands of works of Roman art that survive from the former provinces of the Empire. This is particulat1y true of art in the European provinces, including Roman Britain and Germany, where much provincial art appears to be a poor reflection of the classical tradition, though this should not affect its value as a document of ancient culture and society.\n\nWhen provincial art has been studied, it has often been used rather crudely as an index of relative 'Romanization', while most studies have avoided looking beyond individual provinces, regions, or sites. More progressive and theoretical archaeological studies, which react against traditional methods, also have their disadvantages. They may deal with art only as one kind of material culture among others and they are generally no more successful in relating provincial works to the extraordinary, empire-wide phenomenon of classical art to which they belong.\n\nThe proposed project is intended to contribute to a broader understanding of provincial sculpture as part of the artistic culture of the empire. It will use the close study of particular works (and existing scholarship on these works) to help construct a wider and more systematic account of how provincials participated in this 'classical' culture. More precisely, it will employ a case study of one especially popular and widespread motif to examine how and why it was disseminated and adapted in different parts of provincial society, particulat1y in the European frontier provinces, and to demonstrate what it might teach us about the workings of provincial art in general.\n\nThe motif under examination is a funerary image: the so called Totenmahl or 'banquet of the dead'. Totenmahl scenes portray the deceased (usually a man) reclining on a couch, probably in the afterlife. He is generally drinking wine and food is laid on a three legged table before him, while he is typically attended by a servant and often by a seated female relative. These scenes, which have their origin in Greek funerary art, are comparatively rare in Rome and Italy, but exceptionally well attested in Roman provincial sculpture throughout the empire.\n\nFrom the first century AD, many gravestones bearing Totenmahl scenes were produced in areas of military activity from the Balkans to the north of Britain, with r -1iculariy striking examples in the Rhineland. The conventional elements of the scene generally remain the same, but there are numerous variations in format. \nDetail, and they represent a wide range of artistic styles and an aspect that is seldom rigorously considered- different levels of artistic ability. They therefore offer an excellent means to explore the diffusion and reception of classical imagery in the provinces, as well as connections and comparisons between the cultures of different parts of the empire.\n\nThe proposed project will lead to a substantial article in an academic journal and will ultimately contribute to a book on the sculpture of the Roman Empire. The article will draw selectively from the material studied in the period of the award and will seek to highlight particular principles undet1ying the diffusion of the Totenmahl beyond individual provinces. The intention here is to build upon some of the very good but rather narrow existing research on such sculptures, as well as contributing new insights on particular pieces.

However, it is essential that these reconstructions incorporate all the physical evidence for a site, otherwise there is a very real danger of misrepresenting the past. Key features when reconstructing past environments are authentic illumination and the environment itself. Today the interior of our buildings are lit by bright and steady light, but past societies relied on daylight and flame for illumination, and thus, as our perception of an environment is directly affected by the amount and nature of light reaching the eye, any computer reconstruction must accurately model such lighting conditions. Furthermore, in many graphics applications, including virtual archaeology, it is assumed that light travels through a non participating medium, normally clear air or a vacuum. For a great majority of synthesised images, this is a satisfactory assumption. However, in some situations it is necessary to include the participating media such as fog, smoke, or dust to provide the required level of realism within the images. In archaeological sites in particular, the materials used to provide interior light, including candles and wood fires would have caused smoke, and in addition, smoke from, for example incense burners for liturgical purposes, might have significantly affected visibility in these environments. In this feasibility study we will undertake the high-fidelity reconstruction of Byzantine art, that is the rare visible remains of the long lasting Byzantine Empire, which grew out of the Eastern Roman Empire. The Byzantines were much preoccupied with the use of gold and favoured it extensively in their churches. In the icons, massive wall and ceiling mosaics and frescoes, the use of gold was meant to illuminate the pictures from within . This lighting effect in combination with certain architectural elements of the churches was used to create certain illusions, including the holy people on the cupola mosaics seeming to step out of the golden background, approaching the viewer . Gold was not only used for the pictures, but also for candlesticks and in hanging candelabra. Byzantine architects in fact paid careful attention to the use of direct and indirect lighting in certain parts of the church building, depending on the firmly defined religious value of the respective space. This religious value was also symbolised by the architectural form and the use of pictures. We have chosen Cypriot Byzantine art, because of its outstanding quality and the geographical closeness of the sites. During Byzantine times, Cyprus followed closely the art and cultural trends of the capital, Constantinople, with especially high-quality art. Today it is in this tiny former rich and peaceful province of the Byzantine Empire that many of most precious surviving relics of Byzantine art are to be found.This feasibility study will benefit from two key recent developments which now make it possible to develop such highly authentic reconstructions of ancient Byzantine environments: progress in high fidelity physically based computer graphics including accurately modelling of participating media, and the availability of novel High Dynamic Range displays and high-precision eye-tracking systems. The goal of this feasibility study is to determine whether there is indeed a significant difference in the way in which people view Byzantine art today, and as it may have appeared in the past as they were displayed in their original environments and were illuminated by candle light, oil lamps and day light.The results from this project should provide new insights into how Byzantine art may have been viewed in the past and provide guidelines for future high-fidelity computer reconstructions of cultural heritage artefacts.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": null, "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF", "text": "Archaeology", "percentage": 25}, {"id": "EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C", "text": "Info. & commun.

Glastonbury Abbey, 2009-13). AHRC funding enabled the full analysis of previously unpublished excavations at this site of international historical importance. Glastonbury Abbey was renowned in the middle ages as the reputed burial place of the legendary King Arthur and the site of the earliest Christian church in Britain, believed to have been founded by Joseph of Arimathea in the first century. It became a major pilgrimage centre and was the second richest monastery in England at the Dissolution. Today, Glastonbury Abbey is a heritage centre and museum that draws a large range of visitors including tourists, educational groups and spiritual seekers of diverse beliefs.\n\nFrom 1904 to 1979, 36 seasons of excavations took place at the Abbey but the results were never published. Critical study of the archive of antiquarian excavations and the archaeological collections has unlocked new evidence for the scale and significance of the Anglo-Saxon monastery and the medieval Abbey. The outputs of the original research project are aimed at the academic audience, including a monograph in press with the Society of Antiquaries and an online database archived with the Archaeology Data Service. The Follow-on project will make the results of the research available to new audiences, including visitors to Glastonbury Abbey (numbering approximately 100,000 per annum), the local community of Glastonbury and the wider public. \n\nPartnership between the University of Reading and the Trustees of Glastonbury Abbey will enable the charity to improve the quality of site interpretation and education offered to visitors. Interpretation of the ruins and museum collections will be informed by new academic research and presented in more creative and accessible formats including digital reconstructions. The approach is particularly novel in using archaeological evidence to explore the local legends of King Arthur and Joseph of Arimathea. These stories have been connected with Glastonbury for nearly a thousand years: they have both popular appeal and spiritual value to groups including the Church of England, the Catholic Church and the New Age 'Community of Avalon'.\n\nVisitor experience will be enriched by the development of digital reconstructions and an interactive map that will enhance understanding of spatial layout, chronological development and archaeological evidence. The reconstructions will present challenging evidence in an accessible way that will appeal particularly to younger visitors, through iPad tours delivered by a Living History team, and family packs and trails. For the first time, an official guidebook will present a summary of the most recent research on Glastonbury, available in 5 languages to meet the needs of international visitors. There will be greater variety of visitor experience and new opportunities to engage with evidence at different levels of detail in a layered approach to interpretation. A launch event will inform the local community; social media and a popular magazine article will inform the remote public of new research findings. \n\nThe educational value of school visits will be enhanced by improving the quality of learning resources and introducing a critical perspective to evidence. Teachers will benefit from the development of accessible resources and lesson plans for the study of Glastonbury Abbey that map directly on to the new curricula for Key Stages 1-3.\n\nThe project will deliver sustainable resources that will continue to enrich the experience of visitors to Glastonbury Abbey beyond the life of the project.

It is one of the few settlements in Western Turkey that has yielded substantial evidence of prehistoric occupation, especially for the 2nd millennium BC (Middle-Late Bronze Age). It was first excavated between 1960 and 1984 by Doro Levi and Clelia Laviosa, whose work indicated that Iasos was occupied from the late 4th millennium (Chalcolithic) till the medieval period. Concerning the 2nd millennium BC, in particular, Levi and Laviosa suggested that the site's inhabitants enjoyed close contacts with the Aegean islands, and especially with Minoan Crete. The discovery of buildings reminiscent of Minoan architecture, the presence of abundant Minoan finds - including locally made and imported 'Kamares' ware, one of the hall-marks of the Old Palace period in Crete (ca. 1900-1700 BC) - combined with accounts in later Greek sources (e.g. Thucydides) of a Minoan sea-empire and colonization of the Aegean, prompted Levi and Laviosa to suggest that Iasos was a Minoan colony going back to that early period. In addition, the discovery of large quantities of locally produced Mycenaean wares showed that close interactions between Iasos and the Aegean world continued until the end of the Bronze Age (ca. 1100 BC).\\n Although excavations at Iasos started half a century ago, this site remains largely unpublished. With the exception of a monograph on an Early Bronze Age cemetery (which appeared in 1984), publications on prehistoric Iasos by Levi and Laviosa consisted of short papers, which illustrated only a small fraction of the finds they discovered. \\n Between 1999 and 2004 the applicant, together with several colleagues from various universities and research institutes, gathered the surviving relevant archival material (e.g. excavation day-books and plans) and carried out a more systematic study of the finds and architecture (including sampling of ceramics, obsidian, and volcanic ash). With this work, more abundant and reliable information on Bronze Age Iasos has emerged: this challenges previous interpretations of the site, by offering new intriguing data relevant to its settlement history and trade networks. For example, work on Middle-Late Bronze Age ceramics has shown that the 'Kamares' ware described by Levi and Laviosa belongs to a later, relatively little known class of pottery, much (if not all) of which was produced on the island of Kos - a discovery that undermines the original interpretation of Iasos as a Minoan colony going back to the Old Palace period. In addition, Melian obsidian and a considerable number of ceramic imports from Rhodes, the Cyclades as well as other Aegean and Anatolian regions have been identified for the first time. Finally, the discovery of a previously unrecognized layer of volcanic ash from the Bronze Age eruption of Santorini is significant for the chronology of the Bronze Age sequence at Iasos and for the study of the Santorini eruption and effects in the eastern Mediterranean. \\n Recent new discoveries or reassessment of old excavations conducted at settlements located on various Aegean islands such as Kythera, Thera, and Samothraki as well as at several eastern Mediterranean sites such as Tell Kabri (Israel), Avaris (Egypt), Miletus, and &Ccedil;esme (Western Turkey) have sparked new interest in 'Minoanisation' and 2nd millennium trade networks. This publication will provide an important new body of evidence relevant to these subjects.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "The research carried out for the planned volume has already had an impact outside the academic research community, and will continue to do so, as explained below.\\n\\n1) Developing a better understanding of ancient heritage is crucial to encouraging tourists and visitors to archaeological sites. The publication of new archaeological research at Iasos, (including discoveries such as the thick layer of volcanic ash from the well-known Bronze Age eruption of Santorini, featured in many television programs) will help to draw more visitors to the site and the local area. This will create financial benefits for the site, as well as cultural and social benefits for both local people and visitors.\\n\\n2) The research for this project has involved the training of both undergraduate and graduate students from UK, Italian and Turkish universities, many of whom are pursuing careers outside academia. The training has involved the teaching of many transferable skills (including practical ones such as drawing and photography, beside the more traditionally academic skills taught in research environment). The volume, once published, will be used by myself and other colleagues in the teaching and training of more undergraduate and graduate students. \\n\\n3) The research for this project has also involved non-academics (e.g. local people employed in various tasks such as washing and sorting of finds, and UK artists who helped with archaeological drawings, but also made sketches and paintings of the village and archaeological site, which have been shown at private exhibitions). This has contributed to their skills, quality of life, and social networks.\\n", "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF", "text": "Archaeology", "percentage": 0}]}, "researchTopics": {"researchTopic": [{"id": "48433216-63E8-4CF1-9DCA-EB8E156B6265", "text": "Archaeology of Literate Soc.", "percentage": 0}]}, "rcukProgrammes": {"rcukProgramme": []}, "start": null, "end": null, "participantValues": null}, {"links": {"link": [{"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/75A9EE9D-2275-4F82-9803-C9D1168C911F", "rel": "PI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/9C10D78F-6430-4CA7-9528-B96B0762A4C6", "rel": "LEAD_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/funds/CF6D71FE-B63F-41BF-BBC0-D240834FAF77", "rel": "FUND", "start": 1204329600000, "end": 1214780400000, "otherAttributes": {}}]}, "ext": null, "id": "F60C4228-EA5C-4A94-9AAC-57EF069BD6B2", "outcomeid": null, "href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/projects/F60C4228-EA5C-4A94-9AAC-57EF069BD6B2", "created": 1582643293000, "updated": null, "identifiers": {"identifier": [{"value": "AH/E004687/1", "type": "RCUK"}]}, "title": "Pilgrimage to Jerusalem and the Holy Land, 1187-1291", "status": "Closed", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Sch of History, Archaeology & Religion", "abstractText": "Pilgrim texts provide a wealth of information not only about Holy Land pilgrimage itself, but also about church history, architecture, topography, material culture, and the social and economic conditions existing in Palestine in different periods. I have made considerable use of them in my four-volume corpus of churches in the Kingdom of Jerusalem, due for completion in spring 2007. A series of translations of Jerusalem pilgrim texts with commentaries by John Wilkinson (Egeria's Travels [1971], Jerusalem Pilgrims before the Crusades [1977], and Jerusalem Pilgrimage, 1099-1185 [1988]) documents the history of pilgrimage to the Holy Land from the time of Constantine until just before the fall of the city to Saladin in 1187. The texts of the thirteenth century, however, have not yet been studied as a group in this way. The aim of this project is therefore to analyse and discuss the principal Latin and Old French pilgrimage texts (and one in Greek) written between the fall of Crusader Jerusalem to Saladin in 1187 and the loss of Acre to the Mamluk sultan, al-Ashraf Khalil, in 1291, and to provide new English translations of a selection of the more significant of them.\\n\\nThe pilgrimage texts from this period are of particular interest, but because the existing editions of them are scattered across a variety of rather obscure publications, they tend to be under-used by historians. (The compilation with Italian translations by S. de Sandoli, Itinera Hierosolymitana Crucesignatorum (saec. XII-XIIII), 4 vols [Jerusalem 1978-84], goes some way to addressing the problem, but relies on some defective editions, besides introducing new errors.) In the first place they tend to be more detailed than the texts of the twelfth century. They are also often more original, representing first-hand accounts of travellers rather than reworkings of older texts. Taken together, they document the changes that occurred in the physical condition of the Holy Places and in the pattern of pilgrimage to them after the fall of Jerusalem in 1187, during its brief reoccupation by the Franks between 1229 and 1244, and during the period from 1260 onwards when the Mamluks gradually took military control of the whole country from the Franks and Ayyubids. \\n\\nThe principal questions to be addressed by the project are: \\n1. What changes affected the sites and monuments visited by Christian pilgrims to Jerusalem and the Holy Land during the period 1187-1291?\\n2. How was pilgrimage itself affected by the political circumstances of the gradual loss of the Holy Land to the Ayyubids and Mamluks, in terms of travelling conditions, the routes taken, and the way in which pilgrimage was organized?\\n3. How did the perceptions, priorities and goals of pilgrims change, and to what extent were their expectations fulfilled by what they saw and experienced?\\n4. What do the pilgrim texts tell us about the condition of and interaction between different religious and ethnic groups (eastern and western Christians, Muslims, and Jews) under Frankish and Muslim rule? \\n\\nI have identified some 39 texts and of these have selected 17 for translation. The resulting book will begin with an introduction discussing the context and dating of the translated texts and the light that they and other sources (including archaeology) shed on the development of Holy Land pilgrimage in this period. The translations will be accompanied by explanatory footnotes, identifying and commenting on the sites mentioned and pointing readers to sources of further information about them. The book will end with a comprehensive list of pilgrimage texts and maps of the period, and a detailed index.\\n\\nI anticipate that as well as addressing the question of how Holy Land pilgrimage changed in the thirteenth century this project will also result in the production of a valuable resource, that will be of use to researchers inthe fields of history, archaeology, art and architectural history, and religious studies.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": null, "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF", "text": "Archaeology", "percentage": 0}]}, "researchTopics": {"researchTopic": [{"id": "48433216-63E8-4CF1-9DCA-EB8E156B6265", "text": "Archaeology of Literate Soc.", "percentage": 0}]}, "rcukProgrammes": {"rcukProgramme": []}, "start": null, "end": null, "participantValues": null}, {"links": {"link": [{"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/54A61B1B-2B54-4848-A35B-180ED2F3A7B8", "rel": "PI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/C41B26C2-7CED-46E9-95E5-B81724A26907", "rel": "COI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/31E4114C-2BD2-4FF6-AD99-7B034C38F04E", "rel": "COI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/86A3AC4C-FDE6-4D09-AB0B-FF79F516FBA6", "rel": "LEAD_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/funds/BC66C7FF-5349-4194-9B25-24F533F94823", "rel": "FUND", "start": 1554073200000, "end": 1648681200000, "otherAttributes": {}}]}, "ext": null, "id": "77D77630-05B3-413E-8718-9BC616405CBF", "outcomeid": null, "href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/projects/77D77630-05B3-413E-8718-9BC616405CBF", "created": 1582643293000, "updated": null, "identifiers": {"identifier": [{"value": "AH/S002693/1", "type": "RCUK"}]}, "title": "Bottles concealed and revealed: examining the phenomena of stone and glass 'witch bottles' and their concealment in mid to late 17th-century England", "status": "Active", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Research and Education", "abstractText": "The use of glass bottles and German or English made stoneware bottles as 'witch bottles' and their placement / concealment in buildings, churchyards, ditches and riverbanks is an occurrence limited to the mid to late 17th century and (largely) particular to Greater London, Eastern England and certain South East counties of England. Whilst this represents the beginnings of 'witch bottles' and their concealment as a practice in the national context, it remains distinct from other forms of popular 'bottle' magic that emerge over the next two centuries across the British Isles. \n\nThis unique phenomenon has been interpreted in two ways. The first is for building protection: here the bottle was placed in the chimney/hearth or under a threshold as a spirit trap. Second is their use as containers of an administered cure against witchcraft. Written accounts from this period by Joseph Blagrave (among others) that describe the practice suggest the victim would fill bottles with urine, other contents such as pins, nails and thorns and / or personal objects (e.g. hair clippings) and then burn the bottle until it exploded or had it buried. This act would inflict pain on the witch and reveal both their whereabouts and reverse the curse. \n\nSince 'witch bottles' were first reported in the 19th century, they have featured in a varied range of publications, are curated in numerous museum / folklore collections and archaeological archives, and discussed on websites concerned with paganism and folklore studies. Their numbers have grown from the few first mapped by archaeologist and museum curator Ralph Merrifield (1987) and have since been recovered from archaeological sites, building recording surveys and or/ historic building renovations. Although many stoneware and glass 'witch bottles' and their contents survive in the present, it is a partial resource that has never been critiqued and surveyed as a whole collection. With bottles often considered individually, interpretations are reliant on Merrifield (1987) and whilst the scientific analysis of liquid contents has since been emphasised by Massey (2000), engagement remains limited to a few independent (i.e. Hoggard 2004; Hoggard in Hutton (ed) 2015) and academic scholars (Davies, ibid). Discussion is largely disconnected from the building types the bottles are found in and their cultural context, such as how medicine was administered and understood during the early modern period, and the role popular magic played.\n\nThis application aims to recalibrate our understanding of these bottles and their contents over 36 months through collaboration and accessible research achieved through partnership with Nigel Jeffries as Principal Investigator (PI) and other archaeologists at MOLA with Professor Owen Davies and Dr Ceri Houlbrook of the History Department at the University of Hertfordshire (UH) - academics concerned with the study of magic, witchcraft, object concealment, popular medicine and the material culture of magic as Co-Is. Beneficiaries of this research will include not just historians and archaeologists of the period, but engage and inform museum / folklore curators, while the subject of witchcraft has an appeal that resonates beyond academia.\n\nFurther reading\nDavies, O, and Easton T, 2015 'Cunning-Folk and the Production of Magical Artefacts' in R.

A successful proposal would enable MOLA to enhance its research capacity, and the knowledge and skills of the PI and the staff involved. Furthermore it would build its IRO status and strengthen the institution's reputation for leading and managing cross and multi-disciplinary teams and projects. The opportunities embedded in this project would also impact and benefit the academic career of one of the Co-Is, Ceri Houlbrook, currently an Early Career Researcher in History and Folklore, with the various impact pathways, methods and disseminations proposed by this project providing for further career development. \n\nOutside of the academic community, the research generated by this proposal impacts on six of eight users and beneficiaries defined in the AHRC's Research Funding Guide (2018, Version 4.1, 58-9). The methods and channels by which these constituents will be reached are considered in more detail elsewhere (Jeffries_Pathways). \n\n1. Public sector agencies or bodies: An important objective with a long-term legacy is to increase the visibility of witch bottles on the Historic Environment Record (HER) online resource managed by Historic England (HE) in partnership with the Association of Local Government Archaeological Offices (ALGAO) and the Institute of Historic Building Conservation (IHBC). This will be achieved by the enhancement of this resource through the translation of the 'witch bottle' catalogue by the PI (see Objectives OB2) for each county HER to input. \n\n2. Commercial / private sector: archaeologists and building archaeologists working for commercial archaeological companies and practices who encounter and discover 'witch bottles' either through excavation or during standing building recording prior to the alteration of a historic building. This group will be reached by dissemination through publication and targeted presentations.\n\n3. Practitioner groups: The subject of popular magic and object concealment will be of interest and relevance to those practitioner groups focused on post-medieval archaeology, medieval and later ceramics and folklorists. A fourth body are volunteers and professionals concerned with building conservation and recording. These constituents will be reached and engaged during the project's duration through targeted presentations delivered to the conferences they host by the PI and Co-Is and published disseminations.\n\n4. Third sector: the methodology required for the 'witch bottle' survey and catalogue (see Objectives OB2) requires significant engagement and knowledge exchange between the project team and the curators and staff of the publicly-funded museums and institutions these objects are displayed and stored. \n\n5. The media: the subject of object concealment and popular magic in the early modern period has a wide appeal and should be of interest to national and regional media outlets (broadcast, print and digital). They will be reached through the development of a targeted and integrated communications strategy working with the Marketing and Communications team at MOLA. \n\n6. Wider public in general: like the media outlets, it is anticipated the research generated by this proposal and its subject matter will generate public interest. We will reach this group by the production of outputs for wider audiences, including social media, and using the already well-established, publicly-accessible, web-based platform - 'Concealed Revealed' Historypin collection created by Houlbrook. https://www.historypin.org/en/person/66740.", "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF", "text": "Archaeology", "percentage": 0}]}, "researchTopics": {"researchTopic": [{"id": "48433216-63E8-4CF1-9DCA-EB8E156B6265", "text": "Archaeology of Literate Soc.", "percentage": 0}]}, "rcukProgrammes": {"rcukProgramme": []}, "start": null, "end": null, "participantValues": null}]}
