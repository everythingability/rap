The aim of the project is to extend our discussion to include those involved with advising on and making public policy in relation to the public realm of the contemporary street. \\n\\nToday the street is often synonymous with anxiety, worry, and anti-social behaviour: nothing of this is new. The opposite is also true, however, as urban renewal, major infrastructure and monumental architectural projects are invested by planners and policy-makers with the expectation that they will redeem depressed areas and renew the social and physical fabric of neighbourhoods and communities: again, this also applies to the past. Led by historians who are specialists on the cities, architecture, and social life of Europe in the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries, the Street Life and Street Culture network over the two years of its existence has brought together those who work on and are involved in the life of historic and contemporary cities and streets. To date, the Street Life and Street Culture network has involved architectural and art historians and theoreticians, historians, planners, public officials, artists and critics, film-makers, a sound artist and an actor, to create an interdisciplinary, international community drawn from the UK, USA and Europe. The aim has been to create a fruitful dialogue with multiple voices that will allow all of us to view the lives of cities, as witnessed along streets, through comparative perspectives. \\n\\nThe Street Life and Street Culture network seeks to understand the broader issues concerning the street as a place of cultural mediation and the construction of identities by comparing perspectives and methodologies from different disciplines, and confronting and comparing Early Modern experiences with our contemporary world as a means of throwing new light on issues. The street is a result of the urban process, a continuously reinforced dynamic between private and public spheres and the negotiation of public, social, and private identities. The built fabric of the street - not just a road along which people speed but a physical and social space created by the buildings that front onto it - forms an essential place for everyday social interaction, as well as a possible setting for spectacular events. The social relationships and the events that take place in the space of the street give particular meanings and resonances - temporary, local, national, or historical - to an individual street as well as to a city as a whole.\\n\\nThe network has sought an historical understanding of contemporary problems concerning street culture by addressing issues that may also help reframe current issues, thus feeding into public policy. This objective has been advanced by the network's varied constituencies and the involvement of our original project partners, CABE (Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment). The primary aim of this bid is to take the network one step further, to engage directly with policy/practice participants and thus to take the discussion we have initiated to a different level. In so doing, we seek again to show the value and significance of historical precedents from the Early Modern period for the debates that deal with contemporary concerns pertaining to the form and use of the public urban space of streets.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "The Street Life network has already had a positive impact in relation to academics, contemporary practitioners, and the public audiences of its workshops and conference. This bid is intended to allow the PI and CI to continue that work by moving the network forward to engage directly with those working in the area of advising on and making public policy. We have already invited and secured expressions of interest from the following national charities and advisory bodies:\\n- The Joseph Rowntree Foundation: in particular in relation to their 'Place' programme, which is concerned with 'contributing to the building and development of strong, sustainable and inclusive communities'. \\n- The Prince's Foundation, who are much concerned with both 'the design of buildings and the public realm'.\\n- Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA): in relation to the Policy and Public Affairs team and RIBA London's Street Scene, which looks at the quality of everyday streets and public spaces and the delivery of such objectives.\\n- The Young Foundation: in particular in relation to their 'Future Communities' programme, which is concerned with 'designing new places for communities and housing that are socially sustainable'.\\nWe intend to initiate and develop further contacts and involvement with professional bodies as well as local and national government, and policing bodies if our bid is successful. \\n\\nBy bringing a broad range of interlocutors to our events, we aim to inflect policy with the cross-cultural and cross-chronological breadth that has characterised the work of the network to date. We will bring key figures from these organisations together with selected historians, commentators and practitioners concerned with the contemporary city who have already participated in the Streetlife network; this variety of perspectives will enrich our discussion and extend its impact considerably. \\n\\nOur programme is designed so that the first phase will enable us to identify the most promising lines for collaboration and research in a closed context, and then the workshops will enable presentation and discussion of ideas and issues within a collaborative and supportive framework but accessible to a small public audience. The partnership of HEI (PI and CI, as well as existing network participants) and various high profile advisory and public bodies will facilitate media engagement and presentation to a broader public. We hope also to be able to benefit from the support of AHRC's own media office to promote our activity. \\n\\nThe intention of this proposed extension of the network's activities is, therefore, not to limit discussions to the academic realm but to enable the network's activities to impact on the discussion of public policy. Such discussionsare at the heart of current and future concerns and debates on the lives of communities and public spaces, and are given added relevance by the government's desire to build the 'Big Society'.\\n\\nThe existing network website, hosted at the University of Bath, will continue to be used (and enhanced) to provide both a public-facing account of our activity and findings, and a 'closed' site for participants to advance discussion and produce and share documents which can later be published in the public part of the site (Archive). Moreover, we envisage that the website will provide an ideal forum for the publication of the continuing work of the network, with the publication of reports, research papers and sound and video recordings of some of our events.", "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "608431EA-925E-44D8-A1E2-8C24B4768085", "text": "Design", "percentage": 0}]}, "researchTopics": {"researchTopic": [{"id": "7A76A7D6-69D8-433D-A35F-0360BC814DC2", "text": "Architecture HTP", "percentage": 0}]}, "rcukProgrammes": {"rcukProgramme": []}, "start": null, "end": null, "participantValues": null}, {"links": {"link": [{"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/663EE509-96F3-4472-9F61-8D0AFC417499", "rel": "PI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/64E84D34-11D7-4052-A5E5-EE5DB33EA9BC", "rel": "PI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/03D8AFBB-3EA5-4885-B036-BD4F9F4F9849", "rel": "LEAD_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/funds/25E88FCE-DDBC-4511-BCE4-6D500754D085", "rel": "FUND", "start": 1164931200000, "end": 1271113200000, "otherAttributes": {}}]}, "ext": null, "id": "04309776-9891-41F0-9853-1947D7679154", "outcomeid": null, "href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/projects/04309776-9891-41F0-9853-1947D7679154", "created": 1582643293000, "updated": null, "identifiers": {"identifier": [{"value": "AH/D001447/1", "type": "RCUK"}]}, "title": "Alternative Architectural Praxis", "status": "Closed", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Architectural Studies", "abstractText": "This project aims to examine the concept of alternative architectural praxis. \\n\\nWHY? The project aims to make a major contribution to the debate as to how architectural practice needs to evolve in order to meet the changing economic, social and environmental contexts in which contemporary architectural practice is situated. The pressing need for consideration of alternative models of practice has been identified by many others, but few proposals have been made. This project aims to address that need by identifying clear models of alternative practice that others can draw on.\\n\\nWHAT? Alternative architectural praxis is initially defined as a praxis that focuses critically on the processes of architectural production rather than the product. An alternative praxis generally pushes at the boundaries of social, professional, organisational and ideological engagement and is thus often conceived by the general public and / or the architectural profession as 'on the edge' of so-called mainstream architectural practices. Alternative models of architectural practice have been largely overlooked; this project aims to bring them to the surface.\\n\\nHOW? The project will first examine the concept of an alternative form of praxis by means of a thorough analysis of historic examples of alternative architectural praxis. From this a more precise definition of alternative architectural praxis will be developed. The project will then bring this definition to a discussion and evaluation of contemporary examples of alternative praxis. The proposed outcomes of the research include a book and a conference.\\n", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": null, "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "608431EA-925E-44D8-A1E2-8C24B4768085", "text": "Design", "percentage": 0}]}, "researchTopics": {"researchTopic": [{"id": "7A76A7D6-69D8-433D-A35F-0360BC814DC2", "text": "Architecture HTP", "percentage": 0}]}, "rcukProgrammes": {"rcukProgramme": []}, "start": null, "end": null, "participantValues": null}, {"links": {"link": [{"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/BDCCCD27-27DE-4CA1-8571-EA27B63CB745", "rel": "PI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/A8967420-49D3-4509-9912-25FB3EC75B74", "rel": "LEAD_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/funds/9C2F3648-C74A-4C12-BFDC-F3C41E093923", "rel": "FUND", "start": 1138752000000, "end": 1149462000000, "otherAttributes": {}}]}, "ext": null, "id": "E4999DCF-B587-4A50-9A62-4A3D4B13C9A5", "outcomeid": null, "href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/projects/E4999DCF-B587-4A50-9A62-4A3D4B13C9A5", "created": 1582643293000, "updated": null, "identifiers": {"identifier": [{"value": "113155/1", "type": "RCUK"}]}, "title": "The building of Elizabethan and Jacobean England", "status": "Closed", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Sch of History, Art History & Philosophy", "abstractText": "The building of Elizabethan and Jacobean England explores issues of urban and rural renewal in the century after the reformation.

"leadOrganisationDepartment": "Architecture", "abstractText": "Research Context:\\n\\nDesign involves making choices and identifying opportunities. The best buildings are arguably ones in which the functional, social, environmental and aesthetic roles of architecture are positively integrated and mutually inclusive. Yet current lighting design guidance, with its emphasis on quantitative criteria, generally fails to take this into account. This study, which aims to carry out a detailed appraisal of the qualitative aspects of lighting in one particular building type, looks to redress this inbalance.\\n\\nA number of recent publications have discussed daylighting design and performance but few have provided in-depth analysis of how considerations to do with lighting directly inform or shape broader design intentions. They indicate nevertheless that a study of library buildings, which brings together research on how users actually experience the visual environment with an assessment of how client and design teams synthesize thinking about light and space, would be very valuable.\\n\\nCurrent debates surrounding both design quality and the nature of libraries also underline the timeliness of this study.\\n\\nThe Design Quality Indicator (DQI) is a concept for evaluating the quality of buildings as they are being designed, built and first occupied. It aims to address both quantitative and qualitative characteristics, and divergent sets of values of developers and builders on the one side and designers on the other, in order to win the acceptance of both cultures. This project draws on the DQI experience and aims to contribute to the debate by focussing specifically on light and its spatial implications, and to assess the product (libraries) in relation to the process of design.\\n\\nRecent discussions regarding the role and nature of libraries have either taken a historical perspective or looked at future design issues. Here the central importance of creativity in design has been emphasised and the idea that imaginatively designed libraries play a pivotal role in social cohesion, civic pride and local identity. Although a number of 'design elements' are discussed in these studies, surprisingly - for a building type where light is an essential ingredient to functional and aesthetic success - the creative potential of light has to date been ignored.\\n\\nAims and objectives:\\n\\nThis project aims to reveal the creative potential of the use of light in the design of contemporary libraries. It will achieve this through the recording and analysis of lighting conditions in eight case-study buildings and one 'benchmark building', and compare these to the intentions of the clients and design team, as well as to the technical criteria for reading, ICT use and storage. Through case-based comparisons, questionnaires and interviews the purpose is to supplement the existing largely technical design criteria with qualitative guidance that responds to user experiences of library spaces and reveals creative opportunities to clients, architects and engineers. \\n\\nPotential applications and benefits:\\n\\nArchitecture is a significant creative industry in the UK with an international reputation for design excellence. This project aims to contribute to extending this reputation by exploring how lighting design guidance can be reframed to act as a catalyst for higher quality design. By analysing a number of prize-winning library buildings the study is looking to supplement technical design guidelines with descriptions of the qualitative opportunities and dilemmas highlighted by these projects, in order that this knowledge can be brought to bear on the briefing and design process for future projects. The aim is not to overturn current thinking and design criteria. Rather the study will attempt to review some of the problematic ambiguities and unintended consequences of current guidance, in order to indicate how design issues can usefully be reframed, and to prompt new ways of exploring and refining intelligent design strategies.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": null, "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities":

"leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Sch of Architecture and Design", "abstractText": "This project assesses the architectural legacy of The Troubles, the social-historical phenomenon between 1969 and 1994 when the sectarian conflict in Northern Ireland was at its most extreme. The influence of The Troubles was such that it has had a profound impact on the social, political, economic, cultural and spatial structures of Northern Ireland. There are many visible architectural remnants of the Troubles in contemporary Belfast, most notably the 'peace-walls' between a number of Protestant and Roman Catholic residential communities. Quite distinct from this recognised architectural legacy, this research encapsulates a specific, discrete and barely recognised aspect of the cultural structures of The Troubles: a range of distinct and divisive architecture within individual communities in Belfast, now embedded in the contemporary urban fabric. As Northern Ireland moves forward in a post-Troubles era, a plethora of housing, roads, landscaping and related artefacts continue to divide and spatially fragment communities.\n\nThe research conceives of a 'community' as a construct of 'People and Architecture', an intrinsic inter-relationship between people and their built environment. Community, housing, and security in Belfast are intricately linked. During The Troubles 70% of bombings were aimed at housing in the 'Belfast Urban Area'. The residential inner-city was subject to fundamental architectural alterations by both civilian and security authorities. These interventions resulted in a profound material impact upon inner-city communities, creating architectural and spatial disconnection that has promoted deprivation and disenfranchisement within these communities. These areas that are at now at the focus of the 'Together: Building a United Community Strategy, the core policy framework for post-conflict Northern Ireland, which emphasises the role communities will have to play in shaping their own future. Whilst there has been much work in the areas of planning policy, sociology and human geography concerning The Troubles, there is a distinct lack of architectural research in this area, particularly concerning architectural design and the relationship to communities during conflict. This study addresses this gap in knowledge, and equip local communities and policy makers with a crucial knowledge-base that is pertinent to contemporary policy formulation.\n\nThe overarching aim of this research is to effect material change in the community life of some of Belfast's most deprived urban areas. The research conceives of a city-wide study that will examine the architectural legacy of The Troubles and engage local communities with these findings in order to inclusively inform related policy formulation. This suggests four questions: What do these architectural artefacts look like? What do communities have to say about this architecture? How can this research inform the related and relevant policy discussions? What are the lessons for other communities, at both national and international level? These questions formulate the following objectives: to engage this area of arts &amp; humanities research with community and policy stakeholders; to foster community empowerment through structured, active inclusion with policy makers; to illuminate and illustrate the urban impact of conflict in Belfast's communities; and, to develop a transferable method to engage local communities as active-researchers of their built environment. A 'community' as a construct of 'People and Architecture' involves a complex inter-relationship between community, design practice and policy ambition. A cross-disciplinary research team addresses this research context. Academics from architecture, photography, social policy, planning policy and conflict studies are working with community project partners and government agencies. This team have developed a co-designed, collaborative methodology with embedded pathways to community, policy, public and academic impact.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "This research will be of benefit to:\n- Academic beneficiaries in the areas of architecture, photography, social policy, planning, post-conflict transformation and community engagement. The research will make an important cultural contribution to an unknown aspect of history. The architectural artefacts of The Troubles are of great cultural and historical significance. Publication through academic journals as the research progresses, and through a 'Steidl' book publication after completion of the research contribute to public dissemination. There will be knowledge gained concerning the urban legacy of conflict that will be relevant to an international context of contested states, such as Palestine, Kosovo, Sarajevo and Johannesburg. This research takes an innovative cross-disciplinary approach and the knowledge generated by the research will extend and enhance the extensive existing knowledgebase in planning policy, sociology and human geography. This methodology provides an additional perspective to this arts and humanities research context and will be of benefit to other arts and humanities researchers interested in how practice-informed methodologies generate data and can engage with communities. Moreover, the community engagement initiatives, relationship to policy frameworks and social policy dimensions of the research, will also be of interest to researches concerned with community studies.\n\n- Government project partners provide a direct link to policy impact. The Office for First Minister and Deputy First Minister and The Department of Justice are responsible for the 'Together: Building a United Community Strategy', the key policy ambition related to this research. This research has the capacity to influence policy formulation in the areas of housing, physical development, public safety and social regeneration. These cross-cutting themes are united under the aforementioned strategy and involve a range of government departments. Project partner OFMdFM will facilitate dissemination of the research findings to the related departmental agencies as the research progresses. Two Policy Symposia provide a structured forum ensuring emerging research findings are critically considered in relation to policy objectives. Moreover, in 2015 local planning powers for Belfast will fall under the remit of Project Partner Belfast City Council. Through a series of structured Briefing Sessions, Belfast City Council and the range of related council agencies who will be responsible for the development of local community plans, will be engaged with the research findings.\n\n- Five 'social partnerships' mandated to innovate, and implement, regeneration initiatives with government agencies and communities in Belfast (the 'East Belfast', 'North Belfast', 'South Belfast', 'West Belfast' and 'Greater Shankill') will gain skills, expertise and research informed evidence through the Urban Spaceshaper workshops and reports. The engagement with local community groups offers the potential to enhance the creative output capacity within these disenfranchised communities. Moreover, these workshops directly involve residents and representatives from government agencies responsible for the built environment. This mechanism ensures that community issues relevant to well-being, safety and security, are highlighted to the related government agencies. The involvement of central government project partners (OFMdFM, DoJ) and local government project partner Belfast City Council helps embed impact potential to these key agencies responsible for policy formulation and implementation.\n\n- Other community groups and organisations interested in engaging residents in active-research activities with their related built-environment will be able to benefit from the transferrable Urban Spaceshaper Workshop developed in association with the Landscape Institute. This can be used to provide research-informed evidence to influence policy discussions.", "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "608431EA-925E-44D8-A1E2-8C24B4768085", "text": "Design", "percentage": 0}]}, "researchTopics": {"researchTopic": [{"id": "7A76A7D6-69D8-433D-A35F-0360BC814DC2", "text": "Architecture HTP", "percentage": 0}]}, "rcukProgrammes": {"rcukProgramme": []}, "start": null, "end": null, "participantValues": null}, {"links": {"link": [{"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/BF78A6B6-6098-4E9B-9A8D-10A01F741409", "rel": "PI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/03D8AFBB-3EA5-4885-B036-BD4F9F4F9849", "rel": "LEAD_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/funds/7E61260C-7EF5-4A9B-877C-D4B21B7B3CD3", "rel": "FUND", "start": 1202688000000, "end": 1213052400000, "otherAttributes": {}}]}, "ext": null, "id": "F8B0C5EE-C3F1-495E-BBD3-77E0095CF7F4", "outcomeid": null, "href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/projects/F8B0C5EE-C3F1-495E-BBD3-77E0095CF7F4", "created": 1582643293000, "updated": null, "identifiers": {"identifier": [{"value": "AH/F002386/1", "type": "RCUK"}]}, "title": "Helen Chadwick: Thinking Between Art and Architecture", "status": "Closed", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Architectural Studies", "abstractText": "The British artist Helen Chadwick (1953-1996) produced an apparently diverse range of work using a wide range of media. This project sets out to ask: in what ways, and to what extent, can Chadwick's oeuvre inform and invigorate current architectural thinking?\\n\\nMark Sladen has recently suggested that the wealth of ideas in Chadwick's oeuvre met an unreceptive audience in the 'sensationalist and anti-intellectual' atmosphere of the art world in the years immediately after her death (Sladen 2004). However, recent work demonstrates an increasing openness to inter-disciplinary working, such that the kind of cross fertilisation of ideas that was central to Chadwick's approach is now being taken seriously, both in academia, architectural and artistic practice. \\n\\nChadwick's thoughts on architecture were developed as part of a broader raft of ideas at one remove from her artistic projects; their role was to raise questions rather than provide answers. Her thoughts were not constrained to a narrow disciplinary conception of 'architecture,' but instead enjoyed a wide-ranging and inherently inter-disciplinary approach that included both timely and timeless issues. Her research demonstrates a wide knowledge, appreciation and understanding of architectural issues, historical periods, cultures, and theories, and this brings a remarkable maturity and breadth of understanding to an already receptive situation.\\n\\nThe intention of this project is not to recuperate Helen Chadwick's work as 'architecture,' nor to contest existing art-historical reception: instead, it sets out to articulate and explore the ways in which her work can be brought to bear on contemporary debate within architecture, and between art and architecture. The importance and relevance of the project's questions emerge because the architectural issues she addressed remain current (indeed, some are now in more urgent need of attention), and because her work can continue to raise questions that sustain thinking here. It will ask:\\n-What was her conception of the creative process, and how might this affect the role of the artist or architect?\\n-What factors did she believe affected the experience of architecture, and what role might these play in identity formation?\\n-How did she conceive the complex relationships between artifice and nature, myth, history and both classical and modern science? Where and how might such relationships bear on current architectural thinking?\\n-What questions does her work raise concerning the relationship between theory and practice?\\n\\nThese research questions develop around Chadwick's thirteen notebooks and associated papers, kept from March 1972 up to her death in 1996, plus preparatory lecture notes, and marginal notes in her library, all of which are contained in the Henry Moore Institute (HMI) archive in Leeds. I have already spent a month working in the archive, funded by the HMI. These notebooks evidence a complex and tangled web of research, ideas and speculation about wide-ranging issues. Within this tangle, individual strands of research are legible, articulate, meticulous and triangulated: the first stage of work is to extract the various strands that contribute to her architectural thinking and lay these bare.\\n\\nThe subsequent, more important, methodological move echoes Chadwick's own method of 'juggling' or 'bisociation' (a technique she borrows from Arthur Koestler). Here, these strands of her work will be creatively combined with other critical and architectural theories, in order to demonstrate the range of architectural implications already contained within her research (explicit or latent), and to develop the investigation of these in new directions that bear more tangibly on current architectural thinking.\\n\\nThis project will broaden the understanding of Chadwick's work, demonstrate its ongoing relevance and the incentive for studying it at the present time, and widen the range of disciplinary interest in her oeuvre.", "techAbstractText": null,

inner-city Belfast, 1969-1994.", "status": "Closed", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Sch of Architecture and Design", "abstractText": "The Troubles describes the social-historical phenomenon occurring between 1969 and 1994 when the sectarian conflict in Northern Ireland was at its most extreme. Those 25 years have had a profound impact on the social, political, economic, cultural and spatial structures of Northern Ireland ever since. The consequent reaction by government, security and statutory authorities bore witness to a profound material impact upon inner-city communities resulting in architectural and spatial disconnection and disengagement with the economic and social structures that manage, govern and regulate the built environment. \n\nThis review focuses on a specific aspect of material impact, the built structures installed within the inner-city to divide streets, disconnect spatial continuity, mitigate against vehicular flow and limit pedestrian movement. These vary in implementation and include walls, bollards, landscaping and the locating of housing across the path of existing streets. This material impact is extensive across inner-city Belfast. Whilst the sociological and economic impact of The Troubles has received much research attention the impact of these built interventions has yet to be systematically assessed. This review recognises the inner-city exemplar of Ballymacarrett, East Belfast as a community of disconnected people and disconnected spaces. The considered implementation of these divisive built structures has served to fundamentally fragment and spatially disconnect this community. This review conceives of a community as an intrinsic ecosystem of people and the built environment and addresses the challenging issue of engaging a disenfranchised and disconnected community with a broad range of stakeholders and academic research. The review process is a catalyst for inclusive discussion that involves a team of project partner stakeholders, directly linking the review process with the agencies with the remit and funding to implement urban regeneration and social housing policy review and change.\n\nThe aims of this review are to utilise knowledge gained from academic and practice-based research methods to inform and stimulate discussion amongst key stakeholders with active inclusion from policy makers and the community. Such discussion has the stated aim of developing a policy discussion mechanism that will continue to progress the issues highlighted by the review beyond the review period. These aims meet address the objective of engaging research with non-academic stakeholders; empowering the related community; developing a methodological framework that is transferable to other contexts.\n\nThe creation of buildings and spaces is a complex scenario involving stakeholders across the social, political and economic spectrum. As a consequence built artefacts contain much embedded information pertaining to a wide variety of perspectives that concern, and have potential to engage, the community within which they are installed. The research team of an architect and a fine art photographer presents a cross disciplinary approach to analysing this context. The disciplines have been aligned to provide a historical record that is accessible to a diverse audience of community, policy, politics and academia. Architectural and spatial analysis will identify Case Studies of built structures that will be documented and illustrated through conceptual photographic representation. Built structures will be utilised as mechanisms to extract data of historical and contemporary importance, eliciting new knowledge. Disconnections will be highlighted and former connections illuminated. The key relationships that are revealed will be essential tools towards addressing the very real architectural and spatial issues within inner-city Belfast communities. Such analysis will present a new perspective to the social, political, economic, cultural and spatial factors that shaped physical change in this community in a distinct and extreme period in cultural history.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "A major impact of this review process will be the direct engagement of the review findings with the key stakeholders responsible for urban regeneration policy and strategy review, and social housing policy review. These agencies, The Department for Social Development and The Northern Ireland Housing Executive, are included as project partners in this review process. This engagement will be facilitated through a structured Stakeholder Engagement Workshop that will take place in August 2012.\n\nA key objective of this workshop will be to support the formation of a Stakeholder Working Group that will maintain progressive discussions beyond the review period and help promote public sector impact. The workshop will address the issue of which agency is most appropriately placed to steer this issue forward.\n\nCommunity representation will also form a key part of the Stakeholder Engagement Workshop and this will impact positively on this element of the general public. This Workshop will include specific activities that have been designed to bring members of the community into this engagement process, empowering them with the ability to be equitable participants. The active inclusion of community consultation in the review will form evidence-based findings that can feed readily in a mechanism that promotes policy change beyond the review period, as envisaged in the Stakeholder Working Group. This will help promote cultural change within a community that is disenfranchised and suffers high levels of social deprivation.\n\nThere will also be impact on Third Sector agencies related to this review. The East Belfast Community Development Agency and East Belfast Mission are project partners that have established third sector agency initiatives promoting health and well being in East Belfast. Both agencies will be collaborators in the Stakeholder Engagement Workshop. This process will engage these agencies with the review process and findings, thus fostering relationships. This process of engagement will link the real issues that are highlighted by the review with Third Sector agencies with the established infrastructure to help ameliorate these issues\n\nThe review process employs a developing methodology that is applied to a case study context. A major academic impact of this work will be its transferability to other contexts, where communities are impacted upon by conflict and where built structures can be distilled and interpreted to reveal historical information. This methodological inquiry provides an innovative approach to the Arts &amp; Humanities and will be of interest to related researchers. This methodology and the new knowledge that it provides will be brought to the international academic community through articles in journals like the Journal of Architecture and History of Photography. A peer-review Workshop will take place in May 2012. The purpose of this activity is to further develop the research findings, in-progress, with acknowledged experts in the field, such as Eyal Weizmann (Professor of Spatial &amp; Visual Cultures, Goldsmiths College, London), Stephen Graham (School of Architecture, Newcastle University), Mark Power (Professor of Photography, Brighton University) and David Campany (Reader in Photography, University of Westminster). This will be a multi-disciplinary meeting discussing inter-disciplinary research methodologies and provides a mechanism for knowledge exchange between the participants. The School of Architecture &amp; Design has been developing a research focus in the area of Architecture, The Troubles and The Community, which this research would boost. A follow-up Symposium hosted by the School would disseminate the review findings to a wider research audience both within the University and amongst policy makers, politicians and the community.", "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "608431EA-925E-44D8-A1E2-8C24B4768085", "text": "Design", "percentage": 0}]}, "researchTopics": {"researchTopic": [{"id": "7A76A7D6-69D8-433D-A35F-0360BC814DC2", "text": "Architecture HTP", "percentage": 0}]}, "rcukProgrammes": {"rcukProgramme": []}, "start": null, "end": null, "participantValues": null}, {"links": {"link": [{"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/4ED6E208-4C12-4102-AA21-425B9CF7673B", "rel": "PI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/4653EC09-AF10-4800-9609-4E40C5CFEF09", "rel": "LEAD_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/funds/6A9EDBA0-4D6E-478F-BB54-4DFA5C3B0379", "rel": "FUND", "start": 1136764800000, "end": 1147042800000, "otherAttributes": {}}]}, "ext": null, "id": "1F73BD7B-EC23-4414-BA27-DB498701CE5D", "outcomeid": null, "href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/projects/1F73BD7B-EC23-4414-BA27-DB498701CE5D", "created": 1582643293000, "updated": null, "identifiers": {"identifier": [{"value": "111733/1", "type": "RCUK"}]}, "title": "The Politics of Architecture in Restoration London", "status": "Closed", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "The Secretary or registrar", "abstractText": "My aim during the proposed period of leave is to finish my book entitled 'Power, prestige and identity in the Mycenaean world'.

"AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Cities Institute", "abstractText": "This project for Knowledge Transfer is based on recently completed doctoral research that established the existence of the old but little written about building type that combines dwelling and workplace [the 'workhome']. The history of the workhome was traced from medieval times to the present day in England, and the 21st century workhome was examined through an investigation of the lives and premises of 76 home-based workers in urban, suburban and rural contexts. These homeworkers spanned the social spectrum, worked in diverse occupations and inhabited a wide range of different buildings. This research identified a range of previously unrecognised design issues and building typologies that lie at the heart of this knowledge transfer project. It also found that the most commonly built contemporary workhome, the 'live/work unit', has not generally been designed to meet the spatial or environmental needs of the fast growing UK home-based workforce. The UK is currently lagging behind in this field. In Japan, in 2007, fiscal policies were introduced that aim to double the size of the home-based workforce from 20%, to 40%, of the overall Japanese working population by 2010. This project will provide evidence-based guidance for both professionals in the building industry and policy-makers to help the UK to catch up in this important, developing field.\\n\\nThe key aim of this project is to make the knowledge and conceptual framework developed in the doctoral research accessible to architects, developers, builders, workhome clients and policy-makers, through the creation of a design guide for the sustainable workhomes of the future. This Knowledge Transfer will be undertaken within the Cities Institute and the Department of Architecture and Spatial Design of London Metropolitan University. In collaboration with a prize-winning housing/ live/work architectural practice, a housing/ live/work developer and a carbon-negative prefabricated housing manufacturer, the academic team will develop a series of twelve exemplar designs for sustainable workhomes, based on the typologies and design guidance developed in the doctoral research. These will form the basis for a pattern-book and design guide for the workhome, which will be web-based to make it accessible to the wider community of interest. A number of public events and seminars will be delivered in conjunction with key industry policy bodies, such as RIBA, RTPI, BURA, as a means to disseminate this pattern book and design guide, and to influence policy. \\n\\nOne of the main outcomes of this project will be to encourage the development of the housing market to meet the needs of the fast-growing sector of the UK workforce who are engaged in home-based work for at least one day a week (currently estimated at 25% of the overall UK workforce) many of whom inhabit buildings that have not been designed around this dual function. A further outcome of the project will be to stimulate debate about this working practice and its associated buildings, and publicise the need for these hybrid buildings. The pattern book design guide will be a useful resource for the building professions and for the growing part of the UK workforce looking for more sustainable, flexible and family-friendly working arrangements. The development of workhomes designed to accommodate the dual functions of dwelling and workplace has the potential to bring substantial social and economic benefit to home-based workers, to employers and to society at large. The two-way knowledge transfer between the academic team and their three partners will bring benefit to all parties.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": null, "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "608431EA-925E-44D8-A1E2-8C24B4768085", "text": "Design", "percentage": 0}]}, "researchTopics": {"researchTopic": [{"id": "7A76A7D6-69D8-433D-A35F-0360BC814DC2", "text": "Architecture HTP", "percentage": 0}]}, "rcukProgrammes": {"rcukProgramme": []}, "start": null, "end": null, "participantValues": null}, {"links": {"link": [{"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/2B25C1B3-9A5B-4570-8893-CF114B1534C1", "rel": "PI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/F7E13617-2678-475B-99E4-31479C92038D", "rel": "LEAD_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/funds/37FBC4EE-64C9-41B2-9F4F-C8622DDB529E", "rel": "FUND", "start": 1285887600000, "end": 1309388400000, "otherAttributes": {}}]}, "ext": null, "id": "72E71F28-7039-4B3E-BB4B-7C83DBDEAC48", "outcomeid": null, "href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/projects/72E71F28-7039-4B3E-BB4B-7C83DBDEAC48", "created": 1582643293000, "updated": null, "identifiers": {"identifier": [{"value": "AH/H036644/1", "type": "RCUK"}]}, "title": "Rococo Architecture and Spirituality in South America", "status": "Closed", "grantCategory": "Fellowship", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "School of Divinity, History and Philosop", "abstractText": "This groundbreaking multidisciplinary study of Rococo church architecture and religious culture in South America will challenge the field in three significant ways. First, it will dispute the consensus among Latin Americanists that the 18th century was dominated by Iberian Baroque by highlighting the prominence of the International Rococo, not only in urban centers, but also in peripheral missions where it was transformed through contact with Native American cultures and resulted in novel categories of artistic blending (known often as 'hybridity'). Second, it will break with the prevailing viewpoint of historians of both European and Latin American art that Rococo was merely a visual manifestation of a frivolous and decadent age. A primary goal of this study is to understand the socio-religious motives for the importation of this style into an ecclesiastical setting: I will show that it was the expression of a new mysticism promoted by the Society of Jesus (Jesuits), the institution most responsible for introducing Rococo into Latin America, and that a favourable religious and political climate made Brazil and Spanish South America particularly receptive to this new spirituality. Finally, this will be the first large scale study to acknowledge the substantial contribution made by non-Iberian European artists and architects-primarily Central European and Italian Jesuits-to Latin American art. By exploring the legacy of the Rococo in South America, I will demonstrate the extraordinary artistic wealth of the Southern Cone (primarily present-day Argentina, Chile and Paraguay), a frontier region in colonial times that is still widely considered to be of little cultural significance. My ultimate hope is to drive the scholarship, with its increasingly narrow focus on New Spain (Mexico) and Peru (primarily Cuzco), past its cultural frontier and encourage future studies of hitherto uncharted parts of Hispanic America and more trans-Atlantic inquiries-an approach that remains inexplicably uncommon. This interdisciplinary project will not only integrate different art historical fields in novel ways but will also interact with church and social history, literary and post-colonial studies, and anthropology, opening up new horizons in these fields. I was inspired to begin this project after reading innovative new work on Brazil by Myriam Ribeiro (2003) which astonished Brazilian scholars by revealing that the so-called 'Brazilian Baroque,' a style label with enduring nationalistic ramifications, was in reality a form of International Rococo and profoundly influenced by French and Germanic models. My study will extend beyond the scope of Ribeiro's work in two significant ways. First, it will embrace the reception of Rococo in all of South America, thus breaching a boundary between studies of Portuguese and Spanish America that remains entrenched. This breach is crucial for this study because Brazilian Rococo had a powerful impact on the Rococo in Spanish America, both through the migration of its artists (such as Pedro Carmona, a Brazilian retablo maker at El Pilar in Buenos Aires in the 1770s) and illicit trade. Second, unlike Ribeiro, I will consider Rococo in both urban and mission contexts--the latter my focus for over a decade. \\n\\nI will undertake this research by investigating three kinds of visual/textual sources. First, I will complete my photo survey of rococo motifs from churches and church furnishings in South America to enhance my existing database. Second, I will continue to investigate manuscript sources in archives in Italy, Argentina, and Brazil, such as the Archivum Romanum Societatis Iesu in Rome, the Archivo General de la Naci&oacute;n in Buenos Aires, and the Colec&ccedil;&atilde;o Pedro de Angelis in Rio de Janeiro. Finally, I will revisit and review in more detail 18th century treatises on the spiritual rococo, anthropological literature,and church history studies at the Bibliotheque nationale in Paris and the British Library.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "The monograph and the public lectures resulting from it will benefit a wide non-academic community. I will work closely with non-governmental organizations such as the Fundacion Espigas in Buenos Aires, whose remit is to increase awareness within Argentina of the nation's artistic patrimony and which funds lectures, conferences, exhibitions, and other cultural events. Not only would I be contributing to their goal through knowledge sharing but I would also disseminate my conclusions further through public lectures they host both at their institution and at the Museo de Bellas Artes, lectures that are open to the general public (I have already delivered a public lecture at the Bellas Artes on hybridity in colonial Latin American arts). By engaging in discussions with museum curators at places such as the Museo Isaac Fernandez Blanco (also in Buenos Aires)--the only museum dedicated to colonial art in Argentina--I will be contributing to knowledge about objects in their collections and helping them conceive new ways of displaying and labelling them for the general public. I have previously consulted with this museum during their construction of a themed installation about the impact of Asia on the arts of Latin America, now a permanent component of their galleries. Their collections of rococo Jesuit missionary church furnishings from Paraguay and Argentina is one of the best in the country and forms a key part of my research. In Chile, where I am already working with scholars in the Chilo&eacute; Missions Study Group at the Universidad Adolfo Ib&aacute;&ntilde;ez in Santiago on retrieving historical information about the archipelago's colonial-era mission churches, I will assist them in interpreting, dating, and conserving this group of churches protected by UNESCO. This coming November I will present research on the churches of Chilo&eacute; at a conference in Santiago that not only includes scholars but also architects, conservators, and museum professionals. In Paraguay, by delivering publectures at the Museo de San Ignacio Guazu--a Jesuit museum and cultural center in a poor and predominantly Native American region of the country--I will be able to teach the local Guarani people about their colonial heritage and make them aware of the importance of preserving their patrimony. This goal is especially important as the region is rife with robberies of colonial objects and I believe that a greater awareness of their importance and value will encourage local authorities to increase security and help combat this unfortunate development. In researching my book 'Art on the Jesuit Missions in Asia and Latin America' (University of Toronto Press, 1999) I already worked with that collection and established a new chronology for much of the wooden sculpture there. \\n\\nIn the UK I will present my research to non-academic groups such as ARTES, a hispanic-studies society based in London who have invited me in advance to speak about this book project, and the Aberdeen Italian Circle, to whom I have given two lectures on interactions between Italy and South America during the Baroque and Rococo eras. I also intend to contribute to secondary school teachers' continuing professional development (CPD) by providing short courses in Latin American and Native American cultures for the Aberdeen school system. I was especially active in this kind of training and development for teachers while at Clark University (Worcester MA, USA), where I provided classes on Latin American and Asian visual culture to Worcester county secondary school teachers as part of a national curriculum on non-European cultures. As schools are increasingly responding to the need for more multicultural curriculum, this kind of didactic material will be welcome.

Annual production of concrete is now second only to that of water. While the consequences for construction are reasonably well understood, the consequences for culture have barely been considered. This historical study investigates the global implications, for culture, for social relations, and for the environment, of this very rapid introduction of a wholly new medium into everyday life.\\n Hitherto, almost all research into concrete has concentrated upon its technical aspects, or been concerned with the take-up of new techniques and processes. Some work has been done on the way individual architects and engineers interpreted the new medium, but very little attention has been given to the reception of concrete outside architecture and engineering circles. The present study aims to redress this, and make clear that the use of concrete is not limited to architects and engineers, but includes politicians, artists, writers, photographers and film-makers, whose interpretations have been no less significant than those of the form-giving professions. \\n While architects and engineers have been passionately enthusiastic about concrete, because of the constructional freedoms it has made possible, the medium has been less well received by the general public. The discrepancy between professional enchantment and popular indifference - or hostility - has been a recurring feature of concrete, and one not to be dismissed, but incorporated into any account of the medium. The study is not an apology for concrete, but acknowledges its repulsiveness at the same time as recognising the benefits achieved through it.\\n This is a worldwide study of concrete as a global medium. The approach taken is that concrete is not only a substance, but also a process, requiring the combination of natural resources, human labour and human ingenuity. Variations in the way these elements have been combined at different times and places gives rise to substantial differences in the medium: contrary to what is often said, concrete is not the same everywhere. Likewise, whether for reasons of cultural tradition or political ideology, concrete is not perceived equally everywhere. Through investigations of the medium in various different parts of the world / Italy, Brazil, Japan, USA, USSR - the study explores how concrete has both erased, but sometimes contributed to, the establishment of geographical identities. \\n Within the practices of architecture and engineering, concrete has called into question a number of conventional aesthetic principles. The use of concrete has only been reconciled with these articles of professional belief through the production of various myths, such as the recurrent view that concrete has no history but only a future. A major theme of the study is to explore the origins and persistence of some of the many myths attaching to concrete.\\n Contrasting with most existing historical studies, which tend to focus on the earlier, pre-1939 development of the medium, the emphasis of the project is on concrete after 1945, since when the extent of its use, and its impact on social and cultural life, has been greatest. \\n Recent revival of the architectural use of exposed concrete makes the present study timely. Current works of architecture reveal different approaches to concrete (such as use for purely decorative, as distinct from structural, purposes) that call into question some of the assumptions and prejudices previously adhering to concrete.\\n Ambitious, and necessarily selective, the aim is not new in-depth knowledge about concrete, but rather to reflect upon the cultural questions that its superabundant presence raise for us. The future of the medium, and of historical and critical debate about it,relies upon knowing better what it is/and at present no such comprehensive account exists.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": null, "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "608431EA-925E-44D8-A1E2-8C24B4768085", "text": "Design", "percentage": 0}]}, "researchTopics": {"researchTopic": [{"id": "7A76A7D6-69D8-433D-A35F-0360BC814DC2", "text": "Architecture HTP", "percentage": 0}]}, "rcukProgrammes": {"rcukProgramme": []}, "start": null, "end": null, "participantValues": null}, {"links": {"link": [{"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/204A0358-AD0E-49C5-9CF8-96E028EE8ADB", "rel": "PI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/06284AA4-DF0E-4922-AC08-B1AA99991411", "rel": "COI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/CEB496D0-8DC8-4905-8F65-D1ACDAD75C9B", "rel": "LEAD_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/6848DF27-8BAA-47BC-A3E2-05D2ED076326", "rel": "PP_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/funds/70E79A75-84FF-45CF-B96A-720AA28C2370", "rel": "FUND", "start": 1222815600000, "end": 1238540400000, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/keyfindings/F5818560-E3C5-44AA-A59A-57D5BCB3B8C7", "rel": "KEY_FINDING", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/furtherfundings/C2EABEAD-3302-4E99-9356-8C47C5D363A6", "rel": "FURTHER_FUNDING", "start": 1519862400000, "end": 1551484800000, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/furtherfundings/5CA5870E-9E8D-481E-93A1-E85870A93DA6", "rel": "FURTHER_FUNDING", "start": 1556665200000, "end": 1651446000000, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/impactsummaries/E7E08D1F-87DE-403E-8F53-7F6C29A780B6", "rel": "IMPACT_SUMMARY", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/projects/6071717E-8B02-4731-8EB4-C21D9852802C", "rel": "TRANSFER", "start": 1238540400000, "end": 1301612400000, "otherAttributes": {}}]}, "ext": null, "id": "2BC7804C-63E1-4BF8-9DBD-A79F62106DAF", "outcomeid": null, "href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/projects/2BC7804C-63E1-4BF8-9DBD-A79F62106DAF", "created": 1582643293000, "updated": null, "identifiers": {"identifier": [{"value": "AH/G000417/1", "type": "RCUK"}]}, "title": "Street life and street culture: Between Early Modern Europe and the present", "status": "Closed", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Faculty of Tech, Design and Environment", "abstractText": "Today the street is synonymous with anxiety, worry, anti-social behaviour: nothing of this is new.

"The proposal develops an interdisciplinary system to quantify risk of historic buildings and archaeological sites to driving rain and flooding as caused by climate change; it will evaluate structural vulnerability by defining adequate impact indicators and propose adaptation strategies classified by increased resilience against loss of significance. Project activities are set within the framework of risk management and uncertainty methods.\\nThe proposal addresses how the causes of damage or material change to cultural heritage can be better understood, and when is material change acceptable and damage unacceptable. \\nThis requires investigation of the nature of changes and transformation in materials and of the resilience and adaptation capacity of the built heritage. The objectives of the proposal are:\\n- Definition of criteria and protocols to identify acceptable limits of damage; define consistent protocols for modelling material change; use of risk, monitoring and simulation to inform life-cycle and cost/benefits studies and new or improved conservation interventions.\\n- Impact of flooding, rising water level, driving rain and thermal cycles on structural integrity of historic buildings and archaeological sites\\n- Assessment of novel adaptation techniques to be implemented to enhance resilience of historic buildings and sites to climate change impacts. \\nThe collaboration of structural and environmental modellers and specialists in cultural heritage, working on specific case studies and supported by professional practitioners and the heritage institutional bodies, ensures robust results applicable in practice.\\nRoughly dressed, rubble masonry, earth structures, infilled in timber frames, are the chosen constitutive materials as they are particularly vulnerable at joint and footing level to driving rain and flood. Hence effects of exacerbated structural damage caused by environmental agents can be successfully measured within the project timeframe. An overall approach based on extreme events statistical analysis and quantification of uncertainty will inform all aspects of the research, so that reliability will be in-built in the evaluation of the risk and adaptation measures The research will be case study based to facilitate direct feedback of results into practice. On-site monitoring and laboratory tests will be conducted, considering the combined effects of driving rain and flooding. \\nThe proposed case studies areas are: Tewkesbury, scheduled area at south end of town near the Abbey; Deerhurst, archaeological sites and significant historic buildings; Cottown, Perthshire, cob walls compromised by flooding; Winchester cathedral crypt and Winchester College; York, Lendal Bridge towers and buildings on the Eastern riverbank; Bodiam Castle. The case studies have been chosen according to flooding hazard and to the diversity of age, materials, construction techniques, significance and historical documentation of the heritage buildings and archeological remains in the six areas. Their continued occupation through time allows to: gain historical perspective by looking at past adaptations to documented climate changes; investigate effects on current risk; define urgency of adaptation. Research tasks cover:\\n-Survey of buildings and stakeholders of study area to identify selected buildings for in depth study\\n-Study of secondary literature to identify significance of historic climate change\\n-Flood and driving rain probability analysis and scenarios\\n- Laser scanning and restitution of the building at different scales \\n-On site monitoring and lab testing to define damage thresholds\\n-Hydraulic an structural modelling\\n-Assessment of resilience and validation of adaptation measures. \\n-Generalisation and dissemination of results through drafting of guidelines.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "Four levels of beneficiaries can be identified for this proposal:\\n\\nProject partners\\nWider academic community\\nHeritage organisations\\nLocal inhabitants\\n\\nBesides the Academic Partners' staff and their PhD students whose research expertise and knowledge will benefit directly from the outcome of the project, the industrial and institutional partners will also directly benefit by taking part in the project. The research will impact on the nation's economic performance by assessing materials performance and by indicating measure to prevent flood and driving rain damage. Furthermore, the successful completion of the project and wider application findings will enhance the quality of life and the nation's historic building stock. The timescale for the benefits to be realized is as follows:\\n\\nImmediate and medium-term benefit (up to five years from end of project).

Culshaw &amp; Sumners were a busy mid 19th-century practice, working in a period of intense building activity and urban growth. The project will use the archive to increase our knowledge and understanding of Culshaw &amp; Sumners in particular, of Victorian architectural practice in general, and of the built environment of Victorian Liverpool, much of which is a World Heritage Site. \\n\\nScholars have tended to focus on 19th-century architects of exceptional talent and established reputation, and have neglected the more representative, mainstream figures who were largely responsible for the appearance of Victorian towns and cities. The project will give new insights into the 19th-century architectural scene by concentrating on a well-documented provincial practice whose work embraced a wide range of building types, and who met the day to day needs of one of the largest commercial towns in the country.\\n\\nIt will investigate the development of Culshaw &amp; Sumners in relation to national and local architectural trends. It will identify the range of building types they worked on, and show how they responded to the special demands of mercantile, maritime Liverpool, particularly in the design of offices, warehouses and industrial premises. It will also explore the use they made of new and traditional technologies, such as cast iron and fireproof construction. \\n\\nIt will use their drawings to clarify aspects of Liverpool's growth that have been obscured by later waves of demolition and rebuilding. These include the spread of suburban villas, the rise of high-class shopping areas, and the distribution of warehouses and industrial buildings. These topics cannot be studied in detail from maps alone, and Liverpool's building control records for this period have not survived. The Culshaw &amp; Sumners drawings, a high proportion of which are dated, are therefore a uniquely valuable source for understanding the growth of the 19th-century town. \\n\\nThe project will also examine the market for new buildings in Victorian Liverpool, by investigating clients whose names are inscribed on the drawings, and by examining the relationship between clients and architects. It will look for links between clients, as evidence of how Culshaw &amp; Sumners may have obtained commissions. Comparisons will be made with architectural practices elswhere, to show how far Culshaw &amp; Sumners can be regarded as typical, and how far they - and Liverpool - represent a special case.\\n\\nThe project results will be shared by publishing articles in scholarly journals, and by holding a symposium where scholars investigating the Victorian architectural scene in other towns and cities can meet in Liverpool to compare their findings. This will allow the work of Culshaw &amp; Sumners to be seen in a wider context. The research will also form the basis of a public exhibition of selected drawings, accompanied by photographs showing the same buildings today, to be held in a prominent location in Liverpool. Reproductions of the drawings will be displayed in the buildings to which they relate, including schools, shops, offices and churches. This will increase awareness and understanding of Liverpool's Victorian architecture, and highlight the value of the Culshaw &amp; Sumners archive as an educational resource. The project's findings will also be shared with the Lancashire Record Office and added to their online catalogue, making them available to a worldwide audience.\\n\\nThe research will be of interest not only to architectural historians, but to urban, social and family historians too, and will open up the Culshaw &amp; Sumners archive to wider use by scholars and members of the public.

It incorporated over 100 innovative buildings, including the world famous Tait's Tower and attracted over 12.5million people to Bellahouston Park, Glasgow over its six month run. This last public showcase of the Empire was of huge international significance and continues to be relevant to the study of British social and industrial history and modernist architecture. In 2006, Glasgow School of Art's Digital Design Studio ran the AHRC-funded 'British Empire Exhibition, Glasgow 1938' project which consulted as many sources and individuals as possible in order to build an accurate 3D digital model from which the planning of the Exhibition and its architectural style can be examined. 104 individual photo-real buildings and features were reconstructed together with an accurate 3D map showing the relationship of the buildings, pathways, and water features to the topography of Bellahouston Park. As part of this research, DDS collected and digitised a large archive of related cultural artefacts (architectural plans, photos, ephemera) and recorded interviews with people who had visited the Exhibition and architecture scholars. Limited resolution images, videos, and an overview of the 3D model with some interactivity are available on the project website (http://www.empireexhibition1938.co.uk) and higher resolution versions along with some physical artefacts can be viewed at a special Interpretation Centre at House for an Art Lover (http://www.houseforanartlover.co.uk/news-and-events/news.asp?id=824).\\n\\nThe aim of this project is to improve interpretation of the Exhibition by linking, in a meaningful way, the related cultural artefacts on which the 3D model was based with the modelled data itself. For example, a photograph of a building could be linked to a virtual representation of that building as well as the position from which the photograph was taken. The photograph itself and its relationships will be visualised from within the 3D environment. Other pieces of information, for example comments by architecture experts or video interviews with visitors, will also be linked to relevant features within the 3D model. Researchers and members of the public will then be able to view and interact with the model, either in true, full-scale 3D at the DDS visualisation laboratory in Glasgow, or through an application downloaded to their own computers. DDS will run 'tours' where members of the public can visit not only the digital reconstruction of Bellahouston Park as it was, but also see our state-of-the-art visualisation facility. Researchers will be able to access and contribute to the data and annotations through future partnerships with DDS.\\n\\nIn order to achieve this linkage between the 3D data and related information, this project will develop and test a tool which allows users to 'annotate' the data, and attach those annotations (or files) to points of space within the virtual model, as well as adding relationships between different attached objects (for example, linking all the photographs taken by a particular photographer). This tool will be extensible so that other researchers can make use of it for other 3D datasets in other subject areas and facilities. This will allow both researchers and the general public to virtually experience and collaboratively annotate environments which are inaccessible either because they no longer exist (like the Empire Exhibition) or because they are too far away or dangerous to access.\\n", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "'The British Empire Exhibition, Glasgow 1938' project generated significant local and international media interest (e.g. from BBC, Evening Times, The Herald). It was followed up by a small grant under the Knowledge Catalyst Scheme: 'Marketing the 1938 British Empire Exhibition' (AID: AH/F500203/1) which increased exploitation of the research materials by developing a book, teaching materials, postcards and souvenirs for the BEE and delivering a well-attended conference on the previous project and its outputs.\\n\\nBased on the considerable interest previously shown in the BEE project, we anticipate that widening access to this data both through public visits to Lab1 and releasing the data via download will generate a huge impact. This will reach beyond members of the public with a specific interest in the Exhibition or Glasgow's history and into general tourism. The unique 'virtual tours' of the BEE will be advertised via the Tourist Office and What's On guides and through national initiatives such as Doors Open Day (http://www.doorsopendays.org.uk). There will be a minimum of three events yearly, targeted at different groups (for example students, local history groups, or the general public) for example, the first three events might run on Doors Open Day, GSA's student open day, and the anniversary of the BEE's opening.) We anticipate these events will increase interest in the 3D model which will be made available for public download (along with semantically mapped related cultural material) via the Internet, but also increase usage of the existing resources available at House for an Art Lover's interpretation centre. This new mode of engaging with the BEE data will naturally be of considerable interest to the previous BEE project team and other architecture specialists across the UK.\\nAs before, we anticipate considerable media interest in this work and the opportunities it provides. DDS has ongoing partnerships with BBC Scotland and SHED Media which could lead to further coverage and usage of this data. The project will be linked with other relevant DDS work such as the Glasgow Urban Model commissioned and managed by Glasgow City Council (http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/en/Business/Planning_Development/Heritage_design/theurbanmodel.htm) and our work with Historic Scotland creating 3D models of world heritage sites (cf. http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/index/news/news_article.htm?articleid=24929) with the intention of raising public awareness of this work and the research it supports.\\nThe project will also have a beneficial impact on public policy and activities related to conservation, from local to international level. Specialist conservation researchers and practitioners both within and outside heritage institutions who do not currently have access to analytical facilities to support decision-making will be able to work with DDS on future projects which require naturalistic visualisation and annotation technologies. Releasing the semantic annotation tool opens up the opportunities for engagement with the research - for example, whilst a local council might partner with DDS to work on the restoration of a specific monument (e.g. DDS work on Paisley Fountain: http://www.digitaldocumentation.co.uk/DD09/index.cfm#paisley), a well-funded museum could simply implement the software in their own facilities.\\n\\nFor more information see the attached Impact Plan. However, DDS is committed to maximum exploitation of both the enhanced data and the annotation tool across current and potential future partners in academia, the heritage sector, and industry.\\n", "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "608431EA-925E-44D8-A1E2-8C24B4768085", "text": "Design", "percentage": 0}]}, "researchTopics": {"researchTopic": [{"id": "7A76A7D6-69D8-433D-A35F-0360BC814DC2", "text": "Architecture HTP", "percentage": 0}]}, "rcukProgrammes": {"rcukProgramme": []}, "start": null, "end": null, "participantValues": null}, {"links": {"link": [{"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/7B6E1589-16B3-4413-B2FF-368FF737B5D1", "rel": "PI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/7801F008-7C77-45E7-90E9-4345B47D138E", "rel": "LEAD_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/funds/38EF9813-55D3-4341-80F2-6C8C8A468847", "rel": "FUND", "start": 1285887600000, "end": 1301439600000, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/keyfindings/83299D02-4414-48B4-A484-953C9E4282AE", "rel": "KEY_FINDING", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/furtherfundings/757297C3-4CD4-49E8-84D2-89F541CFB04D", "rel": "FURTHER_FUNDING", "start": 1409526000000, "end": 1504306800000, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/impactsummaries/EA050D32-F74A-4CFA-A834-2545C5C6831F", "rel": "IMPACT_SUMMARY", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/DE7F38DE-F71B-4724-B179-67B9869D211B", "rel": "PUBLICATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/2D1605C2-250F-4365-9E7D-76E6D63733C7", "rel": "PUBLICATION", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}]}, "ext": null, "id": "1FFD60EB-26CA-494F-B973-1D632D542309", "outcomeid": null, "href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/projects/1FFD60EB-26CA-494F-B973-1D632D542309", "created": 1582643293000, "updated": null, "identifiers": {"identifier": [{"value": "AH/H034188/1", "type": "RCUK"}]}, "title": "Tradition in Early Modernity: romanticism, nationhood and the invention of the 'English' house, 1780 - 1840", "status": "Closed", "grantCategory": "Fellowship", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Sch of Architecture Design & Environ", "abstractText": "Tradition in Early Modernity will examine the invention of traditional 'English' domestic architecture in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries as a counterpoint to, and refuge from, early modernity. The project aims to establish the impact of romanticism and picturesque theory across the built environment, the spectrum of English (excluding Scotland, Ireland, Wales) domestic architecture including the anonymous and everyday. The project will tease out the theoretical, formal and cultural threads that precipitated the invention of the traditional 'English' house and will seek to assess its impact upon the English built environment. Prior to nineteenth century pan-European national historicism, the Arts and Crafts Movement and twentieth-century inter-war Mock-Tudor, traditionalism in British housing design first emerged out of the architectural theory and design practice of national romanticism and the rural picturesque: 'a manifestation of the nation's coming to being as a system of cultural significance within modernity' (Bhabha, 1990). These intellectual movements responded to the Enlightenment's universalist progressive rationalism and the social and environmental changes of the agricultural and industrial revolutions, rural flight and urban growth, through a new cultural reverence for a notional rural past as a place of national identity. In architectural design, this romantic conception of nationhood was (is) represented through the reproduction of the forms, materials and construction details of traditional rural buildings. The picturesque celebrated the irregularity and variety of vernacular buildings and took an amoral aesthetic pleasure in scenes of rural poverty and material decay (Macarthur, 1997). Proto-romantic English theories of the picturesque such as Udevale Price's Essay on the Picturesque sought to emphasise the specific aesthetics of place, including local building traditions, over universal, European, standards of taste. British National Romanticism further emphasised the significance of place in the formation of cultural identity and looked to rural folk traditions, including cottages, mills and farmhouses, as a source of inspiration and place of salvation (Curran, 2007; Porter and Teich, 1988). Modernity and tradition were fused in a set of complex interrelationships characterized by ambiguity and fluidity and tradition has subsequently maintained a presence within post-romantic modernity; what Ananda Roy has described as the 'corrupting impact of history upon modernity' (Roy, 2000). Tradition can be better understood not in terms of opposition but as a creative, adaptive and reflective process within modernity (Asquith and Vellinga, 2006; Bronner, 2006). Tradition in Early Modernity is an original interdisciplinary research project that will draw upon literary studies, cultural theory, vernacular (folk) studies, and architectural and design history; cross-referencing contemporary critical writings on tradition, identity and place with eighteenth/nineteenth century primary sources within a fieldwork-based historical study. Research will be divided between the archival study of treatises and pattern books at the British Library and field studies of extant houses (with particular reference to the South West which saw extensive estate and early suburban villa building activity in this period; to be compared with suburban villas of early industrial northern cities). While including the works of relevant architects it is a study of the invention of an 'English' domestic architecture not a conventional canonical study. The project will link current research on the eighteenth (Design History, 2009) and twentieth centuries (TDSR and JAE, 2009) and bring to fruition the wider project: Tradition in Modernity, 1700 - 2000.\\n", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": "Through collaboration with heritage sector practitioners and government agencies throughout the development and implementation of the research, the range of outputs (reports, journal papers, conference) will be specifically tailored to reach beyond academia and benefit professionals within the heritage sector and the historic built environment, and will inform and contribute to regional and national heritage management practice and policy (conservation architects, planners, policy development, building developers, museum curators, historic building inspectorate): \\n\\nArchitectural heritage industry audience through publication of 8000 word-length article in leading research journal in the field: Design History and/or Architecture History: 2011/12.\\n\\nNational impact on government heritage bodies (English Heritage) through production and dissemination of 'advice notes' (2000-words) on the identification and interpretation of romantic-picturesque architecture (to be developed in collaboration with English Heritage (West of England): 2011 onwards.\\n\\nRegional impact through dissemination of research to National Trust South West using close links with the National Trust South West through the MA Eighteenth Century programme (scholarship scheme for NT curatorial staff, dissertations supervised by curators at NT properties).

However, when it comes to urban design, the needs of a wide range of users have to be taken into account and it is highly beneficial if ways can be found to involve these users in the creative process. Participative Design is an excellent way of doing this and this project is concerned with enhancing the participative design process by investigating the feasibility of developing a set of digital tools that will enable non-experts to engage with design at a high level. Non- experts often find it difficult to understand conventional architectural drawings and so, when participative design exercises occur at the moment, extensive use is made of hand drawn sketches and simple card models. Although these tools are easy to use they are very limited in terms of what can be represented and this constrains the ways in which design ideas can be explained and developed.\n\nOver the past twenty years computer-aided design (CAD) has become commonplace in architects offices, to the point where conventional drawing boards are now a rarity. Although when CAD was first introduced it was very difficult to use, it has become more user-friendly and within the last few years a new generation of CAD packages have been introduced that have a much more intuitive feel to them. Also, as computers have become more powerful it is not longer necessary to have a workstation to run a CAD program as an entry-level laptop will suffice for all but the most demanding applications. This project aims to capitalise on these developments by investigating the possibility of adapting this technology to support participative design. This would allow participants to create much more realistic digital models of their ideas and visualise what they are designing in an accurate and convincing way.\n\nThis project is a pilot study which will investigate whether a set of digital tools could be developed to aid the process of participative design. Its objectives are:\n\n1. To understand how participative design operates currently through case studies of existing practice.\n\n2. To investigate the potential of existing hardware and software to facilitate the process of participative design.\n\n3. To describe how that hardware and software could be developed into a new set of tools specifically designed to support participative design.", "techAbstractText": null, "potentialImpact": null, "healthCategories": {"healthCategory": []}, "researchActivities": {"researchActivity": []}, "researchSubjects": {"researchSubject": [{"id": "608431EA-925E-44D8-A1E2-8C24B4768085", "text": "Design", "percentage": 0}]}, "researchTopics": {"researchTopic": [{"id": "7A76A7D6-69D8-433D-A35F-0360BC814DC2", "text": "Architecture HTP", "percentage": 0}]}, "rcukProgrammes": {"rcukProgramme": []}, "start": null, "end": null, "participantValues": null}, {"links": {"link": [{"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/DD3FDC60-96CF-4D7F-9E42-0377818BD5C2", "rel": "PI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/1F32BD02-19BE-49FC-96FD-7D6ABFE870A9", "rel": "COI_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/persons/BA5649B6-ACF4-4DEE-A612-F107378865A8", "rel": "RESEARCH_PER", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/organisations/BD856F04-3042-4F92-8D66-1B101801FEB8", "rel": "LEAD_ORG", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/funds/00C00BF9-2315-4034-A45A-F1603E917463", "rel": "FUND", "start": 1149116400000, "end": 1264896000000, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/keyfindings/D2F87402-A927-4C92-8E8D-133B13C845D6", "rel": "KEY_FINDING", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/impactsummaries/64166823-E447-4972-831B-9B5653012D2B", "rel": "IMPACT_SUMMARY", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}, {"href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/outcomes/researchdatabaseandmodels/F4D60D89-DC92-4A5D-9EE2-9D797EC1F64B", "rel": "RESEARCH_DATABASE_AND_MODEL", "start": null, "end": null, "otherAttributes": {}}]}, "ext": null, "id": "DC545C22-6A68-4D26-A442-4F014E271286", "outcomeid": null, "href": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/gtr/api/projects/DC545C22-6A68-4D26-A442-4F014E271286", "created": 1582643293000, "updated": null, "identifiers": {"identifier": [{"value": "119249/1", "type": "RCUK"}]}, "title": "Online searchable item level catalogue and sample digital surrogate of the Archigram archives", "status": "Closed", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "leadFunder": "AHRC", "leadOrganisationDepartment": "Faculty of Arch & the Built Environment", "abstractText": "The extraordinary influence of the mainly un built 1960s-70s architectural group Archigram is internationally acknowledged.
